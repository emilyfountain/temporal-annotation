    <TEXT>QDEAR BOB: I have a FICO score of 750 and wonder why I am still paying private mortgage insurance. -- Jennifer R.When you bought your house or condo, you probably paid little or no cash down. Because of your high credit score, your lender approved a high loan-to-value ratio mortgage. The lender insisted on PMI to eliminate its foreclosure loss risk.Until you have at least 20 percent equity, your lender still views you as a high risk, which requires PMI to protect the lender.Also, until your home loan has at least 24 months of on-time monthly payments, most mortgage lenders will refuse to cancel PMI. Some especially nasty lenders will not cancel PMI until the loan balance declines below 80 percent of its original balance, ignoring your home improvements and market value appreciation.That usually takes 10 to 15 years, depending on your interest rate. If you have one of these really bad lenders, refinance with a different lender.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Amid happy bedlam on the three dozen bond trading floors scattered about the New York metropolitan area, a piercing wail of anguish rose last week from the respected Bridgewater Associates Inc.'s bond managers."This bond rally has been brutal," said the Wilton, Conn.-based investment advisory firm's daily report, as it agonizingly confessed it had recently lost heart and bet against the bond market rise. "For years, it seems, we've been waiting for a secular breakout of bond yields to 1960's levels. Here it is, and we're short. Obviously it's painful to have missed this move."The bond trading business - with the exception of the short-lived and perilous junk bond boom of the late 1980s - has traditionally been a back room gentlemen's game. It was the stock market that drew the headlines, the high rollers and the rapt attention of millions of small investors."The stock market is a lot easier for the layman to understand," said Larry Jones, president and chief executive of the GovPX Treasury market pricing service, which provides instant computer data on bond trading. "The bond market is different in that it is a fairly complex animal. It depends on macroeconomics," a measurement of the economy on a national scale, "which {small investors} may have taken in college, but they do not understand the real dynamics."Now they hunger to know more, and are joining institutional investors in tossing money into a bond market that has reached record levels in the past few weeks. With President Clinton's deficit reduction and tax policies indicating a slow-growth, low-inflation economy to many investors, with interest on overnight deposits at a minuscule 3 percent and with the stock market volatile and life uncertain, bonds have become hot items even as long-term Treasury interest rates have sunk to an all-time low of less than 7 percent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hunched over a microphone at a congressional hearing or relaxed in a leather easy chair in his office at the Federal Reserve Board, Chairman Alan Greenspan can be annoyingly obscure when he wants to bewhich is most of the time.To keep markets guessing about Fed policy (speculators could profit if they knew for sure whether the Fed was raising or lowering interest rates), Greenspan normally keeps to generalities for Congress. And he has no on-the-record quotes for journalists.The rule for reporters still holds. But in recent days, Greenspanjarred by a 7.2 percent annual inflation rate in Januaryhas abandoned the coy approach for the public. The message that the Fed fears rising prices more than recession has been conveyed with the force of a slam dunk in basketball.In so doing, Greenspan has broken with President Bush, and has pulled along five of the six other Republican governors of the central bank. The seventh, Martha Seger, dissented from the Fed's decision to raise the discount rate. She۪s fearfullike the Bush teamthat the Fed will win the war against inflation but lose the fight against recession.He loft the Fed few options as it saw key price indexes rising. If there were better prospects for reducing the fiscal deficit, a sounder case could be made for the softer monetary policy advocated by Bush and Seger.</TEXT>
