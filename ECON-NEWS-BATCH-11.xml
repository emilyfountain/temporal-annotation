    <TEXT>You asked for a soft landing. You got it.If investors are finding the economic environment bewildering these days, they shouldn't complain. Confusion is the consequence of the long-hoped-for soft landing, that catch-all phrase that connotes moderating economic growth, declining inflation and lower interest rates. After all, a soft landing is neither fish nor fowl. It isn't a powerful economy that drives corporate earnings (and eventually inflation) sharply higher, but neither is it a sickening plunge into recession."We're all groping for the trend in the economy, and the data are contradictory," says Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu in New York. "If it weren't and the statistics were all bad, we'd be talking about a recession. If the statistics were uniformly good, we'd be talking about an accelerating economy and no need for the Federal Reserve to ease" credit.But all this leaves investors confused and worried. Because the economic picture is so puzzling, they don't know whether to buy or sell stocks, and which stocks they should own. That's particularly important now because this is the stage at which the economy is delicately balanced and could move quickly either into a recession or acceleration.And that's the trouble with the "soft landing" analogy. While an airplane taxis to the gate and shuts off its engines after landing, the economy just keeps rolling right along.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The chief opponents of the Bush administration's plan to bail out the savings and loan industry presented Congress with a list of objections to the proposal yesterday but became the target of criticism for the role they played in creating the crisis.Officials from the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the largest lobby group for S&Ls and the chief critic of President Bush's plan, were criticized by members of the Senate Banking Committee who said the league contributed to the problem."If anyone has been irresponsible on this issue, it's the U.S. League," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.). Gramm said that the league's actions were rivaled only by members of Congress who have sympathized with the lobby group's positions.Shelby, Gramm and other senators asked league chairman Barney Beeksma why the league told the Senate two years ago that $5 billion was all that was needed to resolve the S&L problem, which is now expected to cost at least $157 billion over the next 10 years.But Gramm persisted and quoted from a letter the league wrote on March 6, 1987, to the General Accounting Office, supporting the appropriation of $5 billion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's no exaggeration to say that the 1980s were dominated by economics. The politics and psychology of these 10 years have swirled around the central issue of how nations enhance their wealth. Ronald Reagan's economic policies undergirded his popularity. Communism's economic failure triggered political upheavals in the Soviet Bloc and China. Japan's emergence as a great power primarily reflects its stunning economic success.Greedy is the glib label stuck onto the '80s. How silly. Greed had never disappeared; it merely became more conspicuous. The decade's significance lies elsewhere. We rediscovered some old truths about economics. Competition works. It generates economic growth by fostering efficiency and innovation. In the '80s, U.S. living standards and productivity rose. But competition can be rough, and the decade seems baffling precisely because its gains often emerged from disruptive changes.We endured fierce foreign competition and the worst recession since World War II. Corporate America was no longer invincible. It faced hostile takeovers as well as rising imports. Companies were forced to become more efficient and to hold down costs and prices. But their responses-layoffs, plant shutdowns and streamlining-were often hurtful and unsettling.It's been that kind of confusing decade. Looking back, I'd cite 10 major economic trends that will affect the '90s.1) The Triumph of Free Markets: Faith in competition replaced the view that government spending and low interest rates spur economic growth. The result has been stingier government, higher "real" (after-inflation) interest rates and more emphasis on free markets. The change is global. From Mexico to France, state-owned companies have been sold ("privatized"). Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union and China are trying market policies.</TEXT>
