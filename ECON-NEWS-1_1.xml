    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- In an effort to achieve banking reform, Senate negotiators and the Bush administration have agreed to drop efforts to allow banks to expand further into the securities business.The compromise is one of several the Senate Banking Committee is pursuing to remove obstacles its banking bill will face when the Senate starts voting on the measure, perhaps today. The latest version of the House banking bill also drops the administration's proposals to broaden bank entry into the securities business.Last night, the House began its second attempt to pass a banking bill after failing last week, in part because of disagreement over how to allow banks into the securities business. The House adopted on a voice vote provisions that would replenish the bank deposit insurance fund, tighten bank regulation, trim the scope of deposit insurance, and restrict the Federal Reserve Board's ability to keep sick banks alive with loans.But the House delayed until today a vote on an amendment to allow banks to branch nationwide and on final passage of the banking bill to give the House leadership and the administration more time to drum up support for the bill.House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) is working hard to win passage of the bill in the face of significant opposition from Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), who believes the bill should include provisions imposing stiffer regulation on banks in the securities business.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stocks declined, as investors weighed slower-than-expected domestic economic growth and continued euro-zone concerns against signs the Federal Reserve may take new steps to bolster the economy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.59 points, or 0.5%, to 11493.72, its lowest close since Oct. 17.Weighing on the downside were Alcoa, which dropped 21 cents, or 2.2%, to $9.26, and Bank of America, which fell 12 cents, or 2.2%, to 5.37. Hewlett-Packard dropped 21 cents, or 0.8%, to 26.65, after the technology company issued a downbeat earnings outlook for the current quarter and the next fiscal year.The S&P 500-stock index fell 4.94 points, or 0.4%, to 1188.04.The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.86 points, or 0.1%, to 2521.28.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sequenom Inc., a genomics-based biotechnology company, said it will acquire Gemini Genomics PLC of the United Kingdom in a stock swap valued at about $226.8 million, one of the first in what analysts expect to be a series of consolidations among genomics companies.The deal combines two companies that are already working together closely in the search for human diseases linked to genetic defects. Both companies also reaped tremendous rewards by making initial public offerings during the 2000 biotech stock-market boom -- and both have also seen their stock prices plummet since then.Sequenom, of San Diego, makes systems for sifting through genetic data in order to pinpoint meaningful genetic differences that might be linked to disease. Gemini, of Cambridge, England, has focused on amassing large databases of genetic data from twins, disease-affected families and participants in drug trials. The two companies struck a research partnership last June, one that has already produced tentative gene candidates linked to heart disease.Under the terms of the agreement, Gemini shareholders will receive 0.2 share of Sequenom in exchange for each share of Gemini stock. Sequenom shares dropped 11% on news of the deal, and as of 4 p.m. traded at $15.75, down $1.93, on the Nasdaq Stock Market.Analysts generally applauded the deal, which they suggest is a harbinger of things to come among genomics firms and so-called platform companies, which build systems for processing and analyzing genetic data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MCI WorldCom Inc., fueled by growth in Internet traffic, data and old-fashioned phone calls, beat analysts' earnings expectations for the first quarter as revenue grew a healthy 15%.But shares of the Jackson, Miss., telecommunications company continued to drop amid uncertainty over whether MCI WorldCom will make a bid for Nextel Communications Inc., the nation's last major independent wireless company.MCI WorldCom remains in talks with Nextel about a potential acquisition, but the two sides are said to be deadlocked over price. MCI WorldCom officials are reportedly growing concerned about the fall in their company's stock price as the talks continue. MCI WorldCom shares have lost more than 10% in value since April 12. On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, MCI closed at $83.875, down $3.8125.MCI WorldCom had net income of $709 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, compared with pro forma earnings of $191 million, or 10 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.Excluding MCI WorldCom's 19% interest in Brazil's Embratel Participacoes SA and a one-time gain, the company had operating earnings of $688 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with the yearearlier pro forma results of $169 million, or 10 cents a share.

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The dollar sagged yesterday, as news of a widely anticipated 0.50-percentage point rate increase by the Federal Reserve provided an excuse to take profits on Tuesday's powerful dollar rally.The dollar also was depressed by the sell-off in U.S. Treasurys that followed the Fed's action, with bond-market participants concerned that U.S. economic growth will remain buoyant and thus prompt further Fed rate boosts.The Federal Reserve decided at its policy-setting meeting yesterday to lift to 6% its Fed funds rate, or the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. The Fed also raised to 5.25% the discount rate, or the rate at which it sells money to banks.Explaining its decision, the Fed said that "despite tentative signs of some moderation in growth, economic activity has continued to advance at a substantial pace."Traders, who had amassed dollars on Tuesday with the announcement of President Clinton's new aid package for Mexico, abruptly dumped them when the Fed made its announcement. The dollar fell quickly to intraday lows of 1.5150 marks and 98.85 yen within minutes of the Fed's statement; it recovered a little later in the session.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The technology industry, an engine of innovation and U.S. prosperity for more than half a century, is accelerating its recovery from the recession with surging earnings that have spurred companies to sharply ramp up their hiring.The latest evidence for the rebound came Thursday, when Internet giant Google Inc. posted a 37% profit jump for the first quarter and chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported a 34% revenue increase to record levels. The results follow the strong showing of bellwether Intel Corp., which Tuesday announced quarterly profit that nearly quadrupled on a 44% jump in sales.The trio of results kicks off what is likely to be a strong earnings streak as tech spending by companies and consumers picks up. Next week, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., among others, are slated to report quarterly results. Tech-research firm ISI Group projects that overall revenues from such companies will rise more than 10% for the first quarter, compared with a 16% decline a year earlier. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's forecasts a 79% increase in tech earnings for the quarter from year-ago levels.The growth has reached a level where tech companies are pushing to hire again, in some cases engaging in heated competition for talent. That's a turnabout for the industry, which had a series of layoffs last year, when some tech giants, notably Microsoft Corp., had mass layoffs for the first time.The hiring ramp-up began late last year, with demand for tech goods and services stabilizing after months of declines. At the time, Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said the Mountain View, Calif., company was ready to spend again, including on new recruits. On Thursday, Google said it hired 786 new employees in the first quarter and was just getting started.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- A sharp decline in the dollar prompted another round of inflationary fears in the credit markets yesterday as bond prices tumbled."If you had to sum it up in one word, the word is currency," said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. In the Treasury bond market, "we had a sell-off on our hands" as the slump in the dollar continued.Recent economic reports indicating a widening U.S. trade deficit "were sufficiently negative that the dollar likely will decline" further in coming weeks to the lows reached last spring, said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. "The weaker dollar and the perception that it will generate higher inflation is a problem for the bond market."Prices of 30-year Treasury issues fell nearly 1 1/2 points, or almost $15 for each $1,000 face amount as yields on some long-term bonds approached 9%. Corporate and municipal securities also plummeted.The dollar's slide also triggered a sell-off in the stock market where the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined nearly 46 points. Despite worries that a weakening dollar will exacerbate inflation pressure, "inflation likely will remain relatively subdued," said Mr. Lieberman.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Warburg Pincus & Co. is a classic Wall Street "smart money" investor.From 1971 to 1978, Warburg Pincus and its affiliated partnerships invested $15 million in Waste Management Co.; it cashed out in 1981 for $66 million. The low-profile partnership scored another coup in 1983, when it led a group that bought 45% of troubled toy-maker Mattel Inc. Since then, Warburg Pincus has quadrupled its money in Mattel."They're brilliant," says John Myers, an executive vice president at General Electric Co.'s pension fund, which invests with Warburg Pincus. Adds another investor, William Snow, treasurer of Johns Hopkins University: "They pick good companies, and they get very involved in management."The only trouble is, Warburg Pincus's knack for smart investments may be waning. The firm still boasts an extraordinary long-term record: profits that average 25% a year since 1971. For most of the 1980s, though, its gains have slipped to about 18 1/2% a year after fees -- only slightly ahead of the stock market's performance, investors say.Currently, Warburg Pincus is mired in a losing position in Community Newspapers Inc., a joint investment that it made with newspaper publisher Ralph Ingersoll in 1987. Last year -- when stock market averages jumped 31% -- Warburg Pincus's $1.1 billion 1986 fund posted only a 10% gain. Concedes Chairman Lionel Pincus: "It wasn't a great year for us."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON--The breakdown in deficit-reduction talks between the White House and Speaker of the House John Boehner (R., Ohio) could immediately increase the risk that Standard & Poor's takes the unprecedented step of lowering its top-notch rating of U.S. government debt.The credit-rating firm has warned repeatedly that it could move to downgrade U.S. debt if it believes any deficit-reduction deal isn't robust enough to change the country's trajectory of future debt growth. A downgrade could come even if officials agree to raise the federal debt ceiling by Aug. 2. Treasury Department officials have set that as the deadline because after that date, without more borrowing authority, the government could run out of cash to pay all its bills.Messrs. Obama and Boehner had been trying to package a deal that would reduce future federal deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years, a level S&P officials had suggested would be sufficient to avoid a downgrade. A lower credit rating would raise borrowing costs not just for the government, but also for consumers and businesses, which could slow U.S. economic growth. It also could lower the value of Treasury securities held as assets by banks, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other investors around the world, potentially shaking financial markets.Now that the large-scale talks have broken down, policy makers will likely pursue a smaller-scale deal that falls short of S&P's targets. Mr. Obama alluded to this possibility Friday evening."If we can't come up with a serious plan for actual deficit and debt reduction, and all we're doing is extending the debt ceiling for another six, seven, eight months, then the probabilities of downgrading U.S. credit are increased, and that will be an additional cloud over the economy and make it more difficult for us and more difficult for businesses to create jobs that the American people so desperately need," Mr. Obama said Friday evening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the latest sign of an improving labor market, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits in the second week of August was 298,000, marking the third time in five weeks it had fallen below 300,000.The last time claims were so low was in early 2000 and 2006, at the height of previous economic expansions. Jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, are also near record lows when population growth is taken into account.Yet the improvement seems out of step with other labor-market indicators. The nation's unemployment rate was 6.2% in July, a historically elevated rate for this point in the recovery, and many economists believe even that gauge overstates the true health of the job market. The jobless rate doesn't capture, for example, discouraged workers who have given up their job searches.Economists believe that one reason for a lower rate of layoffs is a labor market that has become generally less dynamic over the last few decades. Employers have become less likely to lay off workers over time, though they have also grown more cautious about hiring. Similarly, workers have grown more reluctant to change jobs, possibly stunting career development and earnings growth as a result.But more recently, most of the fall in jobless claims has been driven by a decline in the number of the newly laid off who don't bother to apply for government benefits in a generally improving economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The dollar jumped to one-month highs against the euro and yen Friday on hard evidence that the U.S. economy isn't about to shrivel into recession.New economic reports demonstrated the Federal Reserve's actions this week -- cutting interest rates a conservative quarter point and finding an alternative method to introduce more market liquidity -- were well-founded considering retail sales and inflation data reported Thursday and Friday, according to analysts."The Fed was roundly condemned on Tuesday afternoon for its seemingly detached attitude towards the crisis of confidence in the bank funding market," said Scotia Capital analysts.But the reports have introduced some clarity -- and struck U.S. equities down in the process on the realization that another Fed rate cut might not be such a simple prediction, currency analysts concluded. The dollar, consequently, shot up against the euro with a newfound yield appeal and against the yen with the help of a negative economic report in Japan.Late Friday in New York, the euro was at $1.4423 from $1.4625 late Thursday, while the dollar was at 113.40 yen from 112.22 yen. The pound was at $2.0172 from $2.0398, while the dollar was quoted at 1.1525 Swiss francs from 1.1413 francs.</TEXT>

The sale is expected to generate as much as $550 million for Lockheed, Bethesda, Md.IMS, with 4,800 employees, gets its roughly $580 million in annual revenue by performing a number of tasks for municipal and state government agencies, including administering welfare benefits, tracking down deadbeat dads and snaring red-light runners with strategically placed cameras. The unit is best known for operating E-Zpass, the electronic toll-collection service used by vehicles in the Northeast.The acquisition bolsters ACS's position vying for government contracts against International Business Machines Corp., Armonk, N.Y., and Electronic Data Systems Corp. of Plano, Texas. ACS gets about one-third of its revenue from the federal government but has been less competitive on state and local government work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Consumers aren't stepping up spending at the pace many retailers expected just a few months ago, raising the specter that stores will be stuck with piles of unsold goods later this year.This dimming retail picture is part of a larger downshift in growth occurring across the economy. Consumer confidence slumped last month and the job market remains weak. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve reported consumer borrowing fell in May, another sign that they are wary about their finances.All this bodes poorly for the kind of snapback in spending many stores anticipated only a few months ago. Last year's holiday sales were strong and many retailers expected robust growth to continue through this year, fueled in part by pent-up demand for washing machines and clothes that weren't bought during the recession.The typical retailer has to place orders four months or more in advance of actual sales -- which makes them susceptible in the event that sales fail to materialize or simply grow much more slowly than expected.Slower growth could mean stores will be stuck with excess inventory. J. Michael Stanley, managing director of Rosenthal & Rosenthal Inc., a specialty lender in the fashion industry known as a factor, says stores have been much more conservative in the orders they place now compared to a few months ago.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Adobe Systems Inc., continuing to expand its electronic-publishing franchise, agreed to buy Frame Technology Inc. in a stock swap valued at $500 million.Adobe, which also reported a 96% jump in second-quarter earnings, said the acquisition will augment its software products for creating documents and distributing them electronically. It offered 0.52 Adobe share for each Frame share, indicating a value of about $34 a share based on Adobe's closing price yesterday.The agreement was announced after the close of trading. Frame's shares closed at $26.75, up 50 cents, on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and Adobe shares rose $2.125 to $65.50. In after-market trading, however, Adobe's shares traded as low as $62, according to Jeffries & Co. Some analysts labeled the price too rich, in view of Frame's size and profitability."It looks to me that Adobe is just trying to own everything that has to do with publishing," said Russell Crabs, an analyst at Soundview Financial Group. "But not everything in the publishing market has high value."Adobe, based in Mountain View, Calif., pioneered the market for desktop-publishing programs, including software called PostScript that is used in laser printers.

    <TEXT>MUMBAI - The Indian rupee fell against the U.S. dollar for the eighth consecutive session Wednesday as local stocks slipped deep into the red and fresh concerns emerged over a worsening sovereign-debt crisis in Europe.The dollar was at 52.36 rupees late Wednesday, up from 52.30 rupees Tuesday. The dollar slipped to an intraday low of 51.80 rupees in early trade on heavy sales by a large oil firm and an engineering company on expectations that the central bank may announce measures to ease dollar liquidity in the system. Dealers estimated the companies likely sold about $400 million in the market.The rupee, however, soon reversed its gains, as Indian shares slumped to their lowest level in more than two years. The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index fell 2.3% to 15699.97."The dollar index is in a bullish mode despite weak U.S. fundamentals. This is mainly on a buildup of economic, monetary and fiscal pressures on the euro zone with no signs of a rollout of concrete rescue packages," said Moses Harding, head of economic and market research at IndusInd Bank.The dollar may move in a 51.00 rupee-54.00 rupee range in the near term, he said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gaining the confidence of Wall Street can be hard for a company. But regaining the Street's confidence after losing it can be even harder.Take health-care information provider IMS Health. It delivers information on drug sales and trends to pharmaceutical giants, with an amazing 93% market share. But some investors and analysts are reluctant to give the company a clean bill of health because of management-credibility issues.Concerns stem from the odd reverse merger IMS announced this past March with TriZetto, a three-year-old Internet health-care concern with a mere $33 million in annual revenue. Investors couldn't grasp why the venerable information provider -- with $1.4 billion in annual revenue last year -- was looking to merge with the newly public company, which offers medical billing and administrative software online. Amid the pummeling of both companies' shares, the deal was subsequently scratched, although IMS ended up selling a unit to TriZetto.The company's shares have been given a 5% "management discount" by Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Stephen DeNelsky. He has prepared an interactive stock-valuation spreadsheet for investors in which they choose how much of a discount they want to apply. "It's the risk that when you walk in one morning and boot up your machine that there is another news item with something like the TriZetto deal," Mr. DeNelsky says of the discount.For their part, IMS's top executives continue to defend the deal, believing it would help IMS to expand its Internet strategy. "From a strategic point of view, it was a good transaction; from a timing point of view, we couldn't have picked a worst time because we did announce it simultaneous with the collapse of the technology market," Robert E. Weissman, the company's chairman, says in an interview, referring to the spring collapse in tech shares. "We were not tone deaf in spite of the fact that we did not need shareholder approval. We listened and we modified the transaction."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>American Airlines' AMR Corp. parent and Southwest Airlines reported sharply increased profits for the second quarter, signaling a continuing rebound in the U.S. airline industry even as fuel prices remain high.The results underscore how aggressive airlines have been at slashing costs and running more-efficient operations. AMR spent nearly 30% more on jet fuel than it did in the year-earlier quarter -- $1.71 billion compared with $1.35 billion -- but cost containment in other areas such as maintenance and wages still enabled it to report a profit five times that of a year earlier.Fuel prices remain the wild card and threatens to damp progress if prices rise further. Fuel now represents more than 31% of AMR's expenses, compared with just 12% four years ago, and the airline has continued to revise its price estimates upward. In January, AMR estimated an average full-year fuel price of $1.95 a gallon, which it increased to $2.07 in April and $2.18 yesterday.U.S. airlines are digging their way out of a long-running financial slump that resulted in more than $40 billion in net losses since 2001. This year, the industry's losses should narrow to no more than $2 billion, before turning a profit next year, according to the Air Transport Association, an industry group.Continental Airlines, US Airways Group Inc., AirTran Airways parent AirTran Holdings Inc. and Alaska Air Group Inc.'s Alaska Airlines are all expected to report profits for the second quarter and full year, according to analyst estimates provided by Thomson Financial. JetBlue Airways and UAL Corp.'s United are pegged for second-quarter profits, too, though they are expected to post losses for the full year. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines -- both mired in bankruptcy-court proceedings -- are expected to stay in the red for the second quarter and year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>U.S.AARP, the powerful lobbying group for older Americans, is dropping its longstanding opposition to cutting Social Security benefits. Given the group's immense clout, the shift could dramatically affect the debate over the future of the federal safety net, from pensions to health care. Separately, a House subcommittee that oversees Social Security called for an investigation into how judges approve disability benefits. Over at Biden's bipartisan debt-reduction talks, officials familiar with the talks said they expected Medicaid to be the biggest source of cuts in federal entitlement programs in whatever compromise emerges. And White House officials this week told lawmakers in the Biden group that Obama would be open to payroll tax breaks for employers and employees, as fresh concerns over slowing job growth spill into the talks.The potential for a persistent slowdown in hiring is the biggest threat to the U.S. recovery, according to economists in a Wall Street Journal survey who now expect the economy to add about 2.2 million jobs over the next 12 months, down from last month's forecast of 2.5 million jobs. Good employees are still prized: Many U.S. companies that cut 401(k) matching contributions during the recession are starting to restore them, or a slimmed-down version of them, to reward and retain staff amid the decline of traditional pension plans and mounting concern over the long-term viability of Social Security.The head of the ATF is expected to be ousted over the anti-gun-trafficking operation that has grown into the agency's biggest scandal in decades.Only 35% of fourth-graders knew the purpose of the Declaration of Independence in taking the latest national history test.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people continue to believe, or at least still assert, that tax rates don't influence taxpayer behavior all that much. We therefore direct their attention to the Treasury Department's latest historical data on revenues from taxes on capital gains.The numbers look like a 25-year demonstration of the Laffer Curve in action. As the nearby chart shows, taxes paid on capital gains have been highly responsive to the maximum capital gains tax rate. (See accompanying table -- WSJ Jan. 24, 2005) Especially notable is how, over the years, capital gains realizations and the taxes paid on those gains have tended to increase in the years following a cut in the capital gains tax rate.The reductions highlighted in the chart include the famous William Steiger tax rate cut that passed Congress in late 1978 over Jimmy Carter's objections, the Reagan tax cut passed in 1981, and the cut that was part of the Clinton-Gingrich balanced budget deal of 1997. All of those reductions caused taxpayers to cash in more of their gains and thus yielded revenue windfalls for the federal Treasury in succeeding years.On the other hand, the capital gains tax increase of 1986 -- which moved the rate back up to 28% from 20% -- proved to be a revenue disaster. Taxes paid on long-term capital gains (those typically held longer than one year) fell off a cliff to $33.7 billion in 1987 from $52.9 billion a year earlier. And they stayed at close to that mediocre lower level for nearly another decade. In other words, higher rates didn't do anyone any good, not even the politicians who thought they'd be getting more tax revenue to spend.We aren't asserting that tax-rate changes have been the only factors influencing revenue changes. The performance of the broader economy and the stock market have also mattered a great deal. Capital gains revenues boomed in the late 1990s after the 1997 rate cut, but they fell abruptly with the bursting of the dot-com and tech bubbles in 2001.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- New home sales shot up 7.1% in May, the Commerce Department reported, indicating that the housing market is gaining momentum again after slowing down the month before.The Commerce Department said new homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 825,000 in May, nearly reversing the 8.1% decline in April.Analysts have been astonished by home buyers' resilience. In its daily commentary about the economy, securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. told clients that the home-sales report indicates "that the housing sector is strong, although it may have plateaued."For months now, analysts have been declaring that housing has hit its peak. Yet it keeps on thriving. Mortgage rates remain favorable, and consumers are definitely in good shape. "What can you say?" said economist Gary Ciminero of Independent Economic Advisory in Providence, R.I. "We're seeing the results of record-high confidence levels, robust employment and good income growth."After buying homes, consumers usually turn around and spend more money on appliances, furniture and the like, continuing to propel economic growth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The nation's merchandise trade deficit, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, narrowed in the first quarter, but the improvement was restrained by rising import prices, government figures show.The quarterly gap stood at $38.33 billion, compared with a revised $38.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Previously, the department put the fourth quarter deficit at $38.37 billion.The value of imports increased 1% to $96.54 billion in the latest quarter after rising 2.1% to $95.62 billion in the third period. The first-quarter figures reflected a 3% drop in volume and a 4% increase in prices, however, the department said."It's another one of those reports in which imports grow a little and prices are up quite a bit," said David Hartman, senior economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. "The slow improvement that we have forseen still looks like it's on target."Imports of auto parts from Japan and Mexico grew strongly; other increases included building materials, textile products and capital goods other than aircraft. Imports of petroleum and related products rose 8.5% to $8.69 billion after increasing 1.4% to $8.01 billion in the fourth quarter. By volume, oil shipments fell to 6.09 million barrels a day from 6.9 million; the average price of a barrel rose to $15.63 from $12.74.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In 1973, Richard Nixon, in the teeth of the Arab oil embargo, pledged that the U.S. would achieve energy independence within seven years. Like his presidency, that didn't quite work out. Net imports provided 35% of U.S. oil in 1973. Seven years later, they supplied 37%, and by 2005, 60%.Now, that trend is reversing fast. In the 12 months ended in August, net imports met just 46% of oil demand. Similarly, net imports of natural gas climbed from 4% of consumption in 1973 to a peak of more than 16% in 2007, but were back under 9% in the year ended in August.This isn't energy independence. But just as America's growing energy-import dependence in the 1970s had implications of global proportions, so will this reversal four decades later.In natural gas, the opening of shale resources has caused excess supply and cratered prices. Despite calls to use more natural gas, demand hasn't caught up. That is why the likes of Cheniere Energy now want to liquefy and export natural gas to cash in on the spread between low U.S. prices and much higher European and Asian ones.Capturing the benefit of this price difference will be a central battle in the natural-gas market over the next decade. Exports of natural gas would tighten domestic supply, raising prices. That is risky politically. Michael Levi at the Council on Foreign Relations reckons those benefiting from the natural-gas glut--mainly utilities, petrochemical companies and heating consumers--are more organized politically than natural-gas producers and exporters. The argument that gas should be exported not in its raw form but as an input to American-made goods will be tough to ignore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Use of stock-options contracts to hedge stock portfolios and speculate in the market is surging, pushing options trading to levels not seen since the 1987 stock-market crash.Investor wariness as the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to set records has helped bring new life to this previously moribund sector of the U.S. financial markets, as has the protracted takeover battle for Paramount Communications Inc."This long, drawn-out tender offer has proven to be very profitable for the options business," said Michael Schwartz, senior vice president at Oppenheimer & Co. "But there also has been a steady turnaround in the business, with an influx of new users and a change of direction from index options to equity options."Many participants attending the Chicago Board Options Exchange convention here this weekend are wondering how long the nation's four major options exchanges can maintain their momentum.Before last month, when these markets posted their highest daily and monthly volume totals in more than five years, the consensus in the U.S. options industry was that it had never really recovered from the crash. Thousands of overly aggressive investors, who used options contracts in risky, leveraged trading strategies, had been devastated in the 1987 cataclysm.

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Strong machinery exports helped reduce the nation's merchandise trade deficit, measured on a balance of payments basis, to $35.95 billion in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said.The level of exports and imports both set records, but exports expanded at a much faster rate. The fourth-quarter gap was revised to $41.19 billion; it was previously put at $40.17 billion.Among exports, industrial supplies also posted a big increase in the first quarter. Farm shipments hit their highest mark since the fourth quarter of 1984, thanks partly to strong wheat shipments to the Soviet Union. Overall, exports increased 9.8% to $74.67 billion in the latest quarter from $68.01 billion in the previous period.U.S. exports have benefited from the dollar's decline in foreign currency trading over the past three years. A lower dollar makes imports more expensive and U.S. products more competitive overseas.Imports increased 1.3% to $110.62 billion from $109.21 billion. The figures benefited from an 11.6% drop in imports of petroleum and related products. The decline was due to lower prices, as shipments rose. Big increases came in nonelectrical machinery and passenger cars from Canada and South Korea. Auto imports from Japan and West Germany fell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The U.S. economy beefed up over the summer, despite weak-kneed financial and housing markets. Still, investors aren't expecting the data to keep the Federal Reserve from taking another whack at interest rates today.In its first pass at calculating growth for the July-through- September quarter, the Commerce Department estimated that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the economy's physique -- rose at an annual rate of 3.9%, up a tick from the second quarter's 3.8% growth and besting the guesses of 24 Wall Street shamans surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Their consensus call was 3.2% GDP growth during the quarter. True enough, there was housing-related softness in the report, as residential investment tumbled 20% and zapped more than a percentage point of growth out of the final number. But there were plenty of off-setting bright spots, such as the undaunted millions piloting our national fleet of shopping carts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP and it climbed 3% during the third quarter after posting more of a pipsqueak percentage, 1.4%, during the spring quarter. There were other signs of strength too, especially in exports, which shot up 16% thanks in part to the falling dollar, and business spending, which saw a 7.9% bump. In a separate report, U.S. construction spending unexpectedly jumped in September, with government-financed projects picking up the slack in the housing sector.Alas, nothing is simple for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his elite squad of econo-wonks, who are, as of this writing, putting final flourishes on their latest masterpiece of a press release announcing their decision on interest rates. (It's due at 2:15 p.m.). The rosier- than-expected GDP and construction numbers might not have much bearing on the Fed's decision-making, which most handicappers expect will produce a quarter-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate. That is mostly because these numbers offer a slightly stale view of the economy. "The question now is how well it can withstand even steeper declines in residential construction, the general tightening in credit conditions, falling house prices, oil prices at around $90 per barrel, and their negative implications for consumer and business spending," wrote Nigel Gault, an economist with research firm Global Insight. Such stresses would help make the case for easier credit.But not all dismal scientists discounted today's GDP figures. At Nomura Securities, analysts wrote that "the surprising GDP strength could be enough to persuade the FOMC to defer any decision about the need for another rate cut until a clearer picture of the fourth quarter has formed." And analysts with Bear Stearns wrapped up their GDP commentary by noting refound strength in an employment report from payroll processing giant ADP. "With the evidence [from this morning's ADP report] suggesting that private payrolls grew around 100,000 in October, and with back-to-back quarters of near 4% real GDP growth, the economic argument for a further rate cut at this point is unclear to us." In any event, investors will be surprised with anything other than a quarter-point rate cut today, as they were pegging the chances for such a snip -- via fed-funds futures -- at more than 90% early in the day---</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- William Taylor, President Bush's nominee to run the nation's deposit insurance system, said bank regulators could have done a better job policing the Bank of Credit & Commerce International."I think we have learned a series of things," Mr. Taylor, currently the head of bank supervision at the Federal Reserve, told the Senate Banking Committee at his confirmation hearing."You shouldn't allow someone in the country that doesn't have supervision from a strong home-country supervisor," he said. BCCI, with operations in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and the U.S., fraudulently hid huge losses for months from regulators around the world. No U.S. depositors lost money.Questions about BCCI's actions during Mr. Taylor's tenure at the Federal Reserve were expected to be the only serious hurdle to his confirmation. But committee members seemed satisfied with his remarks. Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the committee, said that he expects the committee will recommend the confirmation and that the Senate will vote within a few weeks. If confirmed as expected, Mr. Taylor would succeed William Seidman, whose term expires next month.In his testimony, Mr. Taylor said he remains troubled by lingering questions involving BCCI. In the U.S., BCCI was able to evade government prohibitions from purchasing stock in First American Bankshares Inc. by using frontmen. "I really have difficulty in knowing how we're going to uncover (such) arrangements anywhere," he said. "I really think it's difficult to determine when two people conspire to change the control of an organization."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The dollar, boosted occasionally by cross trading among European currencies, floated in a narrow range as dealers squared positions ahead of today's report of the U.S. August producer price index.In late New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8447 marks, up marginally from 1.8431 marks late Wednesday in New York. The dollar also traded at 133.58 yen, somewhat above 133.47 yen in New York late Wednesday. The pound traded at $1.7005, down from $1.7075.The dollar opened Friday's trading in Tokyo at 133.35 yen.Some dealers said the dollar may rally if the producer price index is above general expectations of a 0.5% gain. A strong figure, they said, might revive speculation about another rise in U.S. interest rates. But "the number has to be pretty high to get the market going for the dollar -- probably something around 0.7%," said a trader with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.The market would also have to shrug off comments yesterday from U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford. Mr. Mulford said that the Reagan administration recognizes the market's concern that the dollar's increase following the rise of the U.S. discount rate last month could hamper the improvements of the U.S. trade deficit. Those remarks were viewed in some quarters as meaning a strong further rise wouldn't be welcomed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After years of caution, companies are raising prices on a range of consumer products, from cereal and beer to washing machines and toilet paper.This past week, cereal-maker Kellogg Co. and brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos. both said prices on their products are heading up. Airlines, after a period of cutting back, are flying with full planes -- and charging more for seats. Cigarettes and tissues are getting more expensive, and soon cruises may too.Broadly, consumer prices are rising more quickly than at any time in the recent past, after years in which many consumer-good companies complained they had no ability to raise prices to cover costs or increase profit margins. On Friday, the government reported that its index of core personal consumption prices -- the gauge the Federal Reserve watches most closely -- rose at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the second quarter. That was the highest since 1994. Much of that rise has been driven by a surge in rents, but goods prices also now appear to be turning up.Meanwhile, real growth in gross domestic product -- a broad measure of economic activity, adjusted for inflation -- slowed sharply to a 2.5% seasonally adjusted annual rate. In the first quarter, it was a strong 5.6%.Stocks rallied Friday in part on the hope that the GDP slowdown might persuade the Federal Reserve to pause at its Aug. 8 meeting in its campaign to raise short-term interest rates, which have gone to 5.25% from 1% in June 2004. The Dow Jones industrials surged 119.27 points, or 1.1%, while the Nasdaq was up 1.9%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For three long years, the U.S. has been undertaking an experiment in economic policy. Could record levels of government spending, waves of new regulation and political credit allocation, and unprecedented monetary stimulus re-ignite growth? The results have been rolling in, and they represent what increasingly looks like an historic mistake that deserves to be called the Keynesian growth discount.***The latest evidence is yesterday's disappointing report of 1.8% in first quarter GDP. At this stage of recovery after a deep recession, the economy is typically growing by 4% or more as consumer confidence returns and businesses accelerate investment as their profits revive. Yet in this recovery consumers are still cautious and business investment remains weak.Some of the first quarter's growth slump is due to seasonal factors such as bad weather and weaker defense spending. In the silver lining department, the private economy grew faster than the overall GDP figure because government spending declined. But even maintaining the 2.9% growth rate of 2010 would mark an historic underachievement for a recovery after a recession that was as deep as the one from late 2007 to mid-2009.The most recent recession of comparable depth and job loss was in 1981-1982, when unemployment hit 10.8%. Huge chunks of industrial America shut down and never re-opened. Yet once the recovery began in earnest in the first quarter of 1983, the economy boomed. As the nearby table shows, growth exceeded 7.1% for five consecutive quarters, and it kept growing at nearly a 4% pace for another two years. Growth didn't dip below 2% in any quarter until the second three months of 1986. This was the Reagan boom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Argentina reported "encouraging" progress in its efforts to obtain an International Monetary Fund rescue package. But it wasn't clear whether the apparent progress in the IMF talks would be enough to persuade Argentina's foreign creditor banks to roll over a $125 million loan due Wednesday.Argentine Economy Minister Bernardo Grinspun is scheduled to meet with U.S. bankers in New York today, armed with a brief IMF statement acknowledging that "significant agreements" have been reached on a economic austerity program required for an IMF-managed bailout.Argentine newspapers hailed the statement as "the green light" that would allow the country's 320 creditor banks to reschedule the $125 million emergency loan due Wednesday. Argentina used the loan to help it meet interest payments on its $45 billion foreign debt at the end of the second quarter.However, the statement, released by Mr. Grinspun's aides after three days of talks with the IMF in Washington, didn't say what agreements had been reached, nor did it indicate that the IMF package is close to completion. U.S. bankers have said that Argentina has to have the IMF package in hand by this week for a rollover of the $125 million loan to be possible. The loan is guaranteed by Argentine funds deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The statement indicated some movement away from the impasse that has stalled an IMF-managed economic-recovery program for nearly two years. The statement said the Argentine government is working on measures to carry out "key policy objectives" of the economic program, the first indication of Argentina's willingness to meet the IMF's stiff conditions at least half-way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel insists that the city's teacher strike was entirely "avoidable." Maybe so, but he probably would have needed some help from the state.Last year Mr. Emanuel importuned state lawmakers to give him the authority to impose a longer school day and year. His wish was their command, but maybe he should have been more careful about what he wished for. The power was useless since he couldn't compel teachers to accept new contracts that didn't pay them commensurately for the extra time. Nor could he implement reforms to teacher tenure, seniority or evaluations without the unions' consent.By contrast, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker last year restricted collective bargaining to wages and limited annual raises to the increase in the consumer price index. Had Illinois lawmakers passed similar reforms, Mr. Emanuel wouldn't be in this fix. While unions might still be demanding a 29% raise over the next two years, the mayor wouldn't have to accede to more than 2% annually (he's offered them 4%). He could also require that teachers be evaluated in part on student performance and empower principals to lay off bad teachers and pay exemplary ones more.Mr. Emanuel hasn't asked state lawmakers to give him the whip hand presumably because he doesn't want to be attacked for violating teachers' collective bargaining "rights." Last year he assured Chicagoans that he'd "totally reject the approach the governor of Wisconsin has taken" to limit collective bargaining because it was part of "a political agenda." Funny, the unions are saying the same thing about his school reforms.The mayor should be getting a first-class education in how public sector collective bargaining works in practice (or rather doesn't work). Politicians are expected to roll over and accept whatever demands the unions make. And if the elected officials dare to ask for "shared sacrifices"--to borrow one of the left's favorite phrases--unions raise hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Overall consumer prices didn't increase at all in January, according to the Labor Department, some thing that hasn't happened in more than four years.Analysts said the figures show, yet again, that inflation is well under control despite a noticeably improving economy.Last month's steady prices followed a moderate increase in December, when prices were 0.2% above November's. The bitterly cold weather didn't damage crops enough to force up prices, as the cost of food declined last month. Clothing, trans portation and energy prices declined as well, while housing prices moderated. Medical-care and entertainment prices both rose 0.3%, the same as they did in December. The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was up only 0.1%, com pared with a 0.2% rise in December.January's consumer price report marks the first in which the Labor Department has used new seasonal adjustments to help diminish the report's tendency to show larger price increases at the beginning of the year and smaller ones at the end.For that reason, analysts were unsure how much credence to put into the January price figures. "I don't believe the headline should read 'inflation is dead,' but if I saw no change at all in February and March, I would consider it a real trend," said Kathryn Kobe, economist for Joel Popkin & Co. in Washington.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on Federal Reserve reform on July 10. The hearing didn't get much press attention. But it was remarkable. While the House can't manage to engage on important issues like tax reform, immigration reform and the minimum wage, it's more than willing to propose radical "reform" of one of the few national policies that is working well.The bill under consideration is called the Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act. (That's right: FRAT.) To be fair to an otherwise dreadful bill, accountability and transparency are worthy objectives, and FRAT does include some reasonable ideas, such as trimming the news blackouts before and after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. But it also includes some corkers, such as requiring public disclosures--in advance--before entering into international negotiations, disclosures that could make such negotiations next to impossible. How would you like to play your poker hand open?But the meat-and-potatoes of the House bill has little to do with either transparency or accountability. Instead, it seeks to intrude on the Fed's ability to conduct an independent monetary policy, free of political interference.As the title of Section 2 puts it, FRAT would impose "Requirements for Policy Rules of the Federal Open Market Committee." A "rule" in this context means a precise set of instructions--often a mathematical formula--that tells the Fed how to set monetary policy. Strictly speaking, with such a rule in place, you don't need a committee to make decisions--or even a human being. A handheld calculator will do.In the debate over such rules, two have attracted the most attention. More than 50 years ago, Milton Friedman famously urged the Fed to keep the money supply growing at a constant rate--say, 4% or 5% per year--rather than varying money growth to influence inflation or unemployment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The House, in a stunning victory for President Bush, agreed to cut the tax on capital gains, soundly rejecting an alternative proposed by Democratic leaders.After weeks of intense lobbying by both sides, the leadership's plan was defeated by a larger-than-expected 239-190 vote. The convincing margin increases the likelihood that a capital gains cut of some sort could become law this year.The vote was a blow to the House's newly elected Democratic leadership, particularly Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri. Both had put their personal prestige on the line to defeat the tax-cut measure, which represented their first major showdown with the Bush administration.Still, fully one-quarter of their membership -- 64 Democrats -- deserted them and sided with a near-solid phalanx of Republicans. Only one Republican, Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, broke ranks and voted, against the wishes of President Bush, for the Democratic alternative."This was a watershed for us," glowed House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois.</TEXT>

It gains credibility from a foreword by Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who calls it "novel and brilliant." Mr. Batra has already made the cover of Financial World."I am no astrologer, no psychic," the author assures us, "not a sensationalist or a Jeremiah." But that doesn't exhaust the possibilities. Mr. Batra is proud of his "obsession" with the teachings of Prabhat Ranja Sarkar, described as an expert in many disciplines, "above all, spirituality." The disciple discovered that "here at last was a philosophy of history that in one stroke could unravel the mystery of every social phenomenon." Like Marx, Mr. Batra's guru preaches historical determinism and class conflict, but adds warriors and intellectuals to the usual classes of exploited laborers and greedy acquisitors (capitalists)."The acquisitors grow richer and richer at the expense of other classes," the author explains. Fortunately, this "will force a crisis that will ultimately give way to sanity in politics, the economy, and the general state of affairs.""Eventually, things become so wretched that angry warriors and intellectuals rise in rebellion and with the help of laborers bring an end to the age of acquisitors. . . . Society will then move into another warrior age."What will this new "sanity" look like? "In the warrior age the army, headed by a dictator . . . controls the government as well as society. Political authority is centralized in the form of an absolute government, people are highly disciplined, family ties are morally binding, women are well respected, and so on."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>AS THE U.S. has grown ever reliant on foreign central banks to finance its trade and budget deficits, the question arises: Could foreign governments, like China's, one day use this clout to influence U.S. foreign policy? Most experts say it's far-fetched. But some look at history and the state of modern markets and are worried."There is surely something odd about the world's greatest power being the world's greatest debtor," Lawrence Summers, Harvard University president and former U.S. Treasury secretary, said in a recent speech. He calls it "troubling" that the U.S. depends so much on "inevitably political" entities to finance its foreign debts.Last year, the U.S. ran a $542 billion deficit in its current account -- the balance of goods and services between the U.S. and the rest of the world -- which had to be financed by selling stocks, bonds, and other assets to foreigners. The U.S. has run such deficits for years, but most of the time they were financed by private investors and their purchases were seen as a sign of confidence in the U.S. economy. But in recent years, private inflows haven't kept pace with the growth in the current-account deficit and foreign central banks have stepped into the breach, buying more than $200 billion of U.S. assets, mostly Treasury bonds and bills, last year. They do this to hold the dollar's value up against their own currencies, which makes their exports more competitive.Foreign central banks, led by China's and Japan's, now hold close to $1 trillion of Treasury bonds and bills, almost a quarter of publicly held U.S. debt. That serves their economic interest, but it also gives them a potential financial lever.IMAGINE A standoff between the U.S. and China over Taiwanese independence. What would happen if China stopped buying U.S. bonds, or sold them outright? As bond prices fell, their yields, which move in the opposite direction, would rise. Mortgage rates would rise, depressing home sales and weakening the economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even as job losses mount and profits plunge, some glimmers of stabilization are emerging in global markets.In the U.S., Europe and China, separate surveys of manufacturers' purchasing managers all inched upward in January, suggesting that the contraction in manufacturing activity could be slowing. The interest rates at which banks lend to one another are easing. And some credit markets are thawing.Analysts say rock-bottom official interest rates, promises of massive fiscal-stimulus packages and central banks' other efforts to revive markets have helped ease some tensions in financial markets and may help put a floor under falling business confidence. As the government rescue efforts work their way through the markets, they could lay the groundwork for the global economy to begin escaping the worst of the storm.But the current hints of stabilization come at very low levels, and with the financial system still fragile, suggesting the year ahead will be rocky at best. And the hopeful signs could still turn ugly, especially with employment falling and draining household incomes."Some of the numbers we had been seeing were just jaw-droppingly awful," said Ken Wattret, economist with BNP Paribas in London. "What we're getting now is a sense that the pace of contraction won't continue at that rate. But it's really a question of being less bad."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department acknowledged that its tally of jobs in the U.S. exceeds the total estimates made by the 50 states, raising the possibility that the federal government is overstating the economy's strength.Labor Department officials said it is too soon to tell which tally is more accurate.In March, the two estimates of nonfarm payroll employment were nearly the same. But since then, the two sets of figures have diverged. In September, the national tally was roughly 400,000 larger than the sum of state estimates -- before taking into account seasonal adjustments -- according to Labor Department figures.Earlier this year, the Labor Department lowered its estimate of the total number of jobs in the economy a seasonally adjusted 658,000, or 0.6%, because of a similar gap between the national and state data. The revisions made the recession look worse than it had previously.William G. Barron, the deputy commissioner of labor statistics, are likely to address the issue in testimony today before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Labor Department officials said. But it will be several months before the department's experts will know for sure if a large revision of the federal statistics are necessary.</TEXT>

Just since 1999, the dollar has moved from $1.17 per euro to $0.83 in 2001, and to $1.27 today, matching moves in the dollar's value in terms of gold and commodities. The impact of this volatility on U.S. farmers and manufacturers, developing countries, tourism, and investment flows has been immense and disruptive.At last weekend's G7 meeting, the powerful group of finance ministers and central bankers accepted this, asserting that exchange rates should be flexible and reflect economic fundamentals. The U.S. hopes the G7 language will form a lasting consensus and be viewed as a set of long-term currency principles. But there's a hitch: Rather than "reflecting" fundamentals, the exchange rate is itself a key fundamental. It affects capital flows, jobs, inflation, and interest rates. Currency changes harm the relationship between debtors and creditors and dominate the profitability of many companies.Without considering the exchange rate, there is not even a ballpark economic definition of a country's fundamentals -- one can't tell whether monetary policy is tight or loose, or inflation likely to rise or fall. If the idea is that strong economic fundamentals cause a strong currency -- as the Clinton administration argued -- it is unclear why the Bush administration seems so comfortable with the two- year weakness in the dollar. It surely doesn't agree with the dollar- bears' claim that U.S. fundamentals have deteriorated substantially due to the tax cuts and fiscal deficits.My view is the opposite. U.S. fundamentals are much better now than in 2000, in large part due to the change in the value of the dollar and the improved tax structure. The fundamentals are reflected in important new records in GDP, total employment according to the household survey, corporate profits, productivity and disposable personal income. The U.S. potential growth rate in coming years is one of the best on record, and hard to explain if the current value of the dollar is thought to "reflect" economic fundamentals.The irony in the fascination with the G7's exchange-rate language is that the causal relationship from economic fundamentals to currencies works so poorly. The dollar reached its peak value in 2001 after the recession started. Dollar strength wasn't the sole cause -- lax regulation plus high tax rates, interest rates, and oil prices contributed -- but the dollar certainly didn't reflect U.S. fundamentals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Postal Service and Wall Street will remain open on Friday, Dec. 26, despite President Clinton's order giving federal workers the day off.There's a longstanding tradition of giving federal workers a four-day weekend when Christmas falls on a Thursday. In 1986, the last time it happened, the Postal Service also continued working.Other federal employees may also be required to work for reasons of national security, defense or other public need.Banks are likely to be open on Dec. 26 as usual, because the Federal Reserve banks around the country will be open, as will their clearing banks, according to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. The Federal Reserve Board itself, the policy-making entity in Washington, will be closed, said Joseph Clyne, assistant to the board. Mr. Clyne said the Federal Reserve will be issuing the required weekly condition statement regarding federal reserve banks that day.The New York Stock Exchange also will continue with its planned operations that day, closing early at 1 p.m. EST, a spokesman said. The Nasdaq Stock Market, which tends to mirror the schedule of the Big Board, also plans a 1 p.m. closing, as does the American Stock Exchange.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- A plan to end a program that would cut government payments to doctors is emerging as the flash point in the debate over whether President Barack Obama's effort to overhaul the health system would increase the federal budget deficit.The proposal was crucial to winning support from the politically powerful American Medical Association -- but it has also made it tougher to argue that the health overhaul would pay for itself.President Obama this week plans to continue his bid to drum up support for his goal to expand health insurance to the nation's 46 million uninsured Americans, after suffering some setbacks last week. On Capitol Hill this week, House members hope to pass their health bill through a third and final committee, and senators are expected to resume talks to hammer out an agreement on the only bipartisan health bill taking shape in Congress.Administration officials on Sunday expressed confidence that lawmakers could pass legislation before Congress's August recess. "The chances are high" that Congress can meet the deadline, White House budget director Peter Orszag told "Fox News Sunday," but he added that lawmakers should amend the legislation to help contain costs.Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," said costs associated with the legislation could be reduced significantly if lawmakers included the administration's recommendation to bolster the power of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, to set Medicare payment policies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Washington -- Contrary to popular belief, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is capable of speaking clearly. A case in point was earlier this month, up on Capitol Hill, when he held forth on the mundane but vital issue of pricing."A striking feature" of the current economic cycle, the Fed chairman said, "has been the virtual absence of pricing power across much of American business."Well said, Mr. Chairman. Raising prices has always been an art form, but these days it is approaching the status of a lost art form. Yes, there are the usual suspects that can achieve "pricing power" in good times and bad. They tend to be the rare "service" providers without global competition: universities that raise tuition; hospitals jacking up fees; or near monopolies such as cable-television operators. Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15% since mid-2000.But for every business operating in a Comcast-type world these days, many more operate in what might be called a Wal-Mart world of flat or falling prices. Wal-Mart is famous for extracting ever-lower prices from its global army of suppliers. In turn, this forces suppliers to stay profitable by means of productivity gains instead of price increases. It's a powerful force that James Smith, an economist at the University of North Carolina, dubs "the Wal-Martization of the U.S. economy."Thus, as the economy gathers strength, there's a big question looming. When will the discounting, rebating and price-cutting reverse course? What happens if industries shutter excess factories around the world or if inventories are trimmed? What happens to prices if industries become more concentrated oligopolies?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stocks extended their winning streak to three sessions as investors appeared to become more confident that the market could withstand a scaling back of easing efforts by the Federal Reserve.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 88.85 points, or 0.6%, to 15224.69. On Friday, the Dow rose 147 points after a better-than-expected June jobs report.The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.57 points, or 0.5%, to 1640.46. Eight of the index's 10 sectors advanced. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite Index gained 5.45 points, or 0.2%, to 3484.83.Monday's gains came in the wake of a stronger-than-expected employment report Friday, which many in the market believe makes it more likely that the Fed will scale back its easing efforts later this year.While stocks have struggled in recent weeks as investors wrestled with the possibility that the Fed might cut back on its support for the U.S. economy, the resilience of stocks following the jobs report suggests the market may have turned a corner, some said.</TEXT>

And, just like in a court of law, one party wins while the other loses. Necessarily, I must "favor" either the worker or the employer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rome -- IN AN ELECTION that came down to a handful of votes, Italy's center-left coalition leader Romano Prodi appeared to eke out a narrow victory -- but by such a razor-thin margin that it is unlikely his longtime adversary, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will be consigned to the sidelines.Mr. Berlusconi, speaking on national television yesterday evening, refused to concede defeat and suggested that it might be necessary to form a coalition government with his political foes. He also spoke of "numerous irregularities" in the voting, without being more specific.About half a million ballots were declared invalid, and if they are re-examined, as members of Mr. Berlusconi's coalition have demanded, it is possible the outcome of the vote could flip. A recount could prompt a period of political uncertainty and lead to a contested final outcome -- a situation analogous to the protracted stalemate between George W. Bush and Al Gore following the U.S. presidential election in 2000.In addition, the vote leaves room for the 69-year-old Mr. Berlusconi, who has made a career of defying the odds, to wield tremendous influence on the political stage. Even if Mr. Prodi's lead is confirmed, his thin margin will make it difficult to push through any of the economic restructuring measures many economists believe the country badly needs."Before this election we were hoping that we'd be able to assess the strategy of the new government, whoever they were, for dealing with [Italy's] public finance problems," said Brian Coulton, a Fitch ratings analyst. "Now there's the risk that it will be impossible to have any kind of strategy."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration has drafted sweeping plans to remake Iraq's economy in the U.S. image.Hoping to establish a free-market economy in Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein, the U.S. is calling for the privatization of state-owned industries such as parts of the oil sector, forming a stock market complete with electronic trading and fundamental tax reform.Execution of the plan -- which is expected to be complicated and possibly contentious -- will fall largely to private American contractors working alongside a smaller team of U.S. officials. The initial plans are laid out in a confidential 100-page U.S. contracting document titled "Moving The Iraqi Economy From Recovery to Sustainable Growth." The consulting work could be valued at as much as $70 million for the first year.The U.S. Agency for International Development plans to award part of the work to BearingPoint Inc., a Virginia-based consulting firm known previously as KPMG Consulting, an AID official said. BearingPoint, which received a similar $40 million job to do economic work in Afghanistan, was approached as a sole-source bidder. AID plans to open the larger share of the work, including privatization and small-enterprise development, to a limited pool of competitors likely to include Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and International Business Machines Corp.'s recently acquired PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting unit. Unlike some of the construction companies that have won contracts, BearingPoint has made few political contributions to either party in the past two years.AID has been criticized by some in Congress for the secretive way it has awarded other Iraq reconstruction contracts over the past two months. But AID officials said these contracts will be awarded under the same expedited rules to launch work as quickly as possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Until last week, Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. had been expecting a recession in the first half of this year. "A slump is still possible," he says, "but now we feel more comfortable with a muddling-through scenario."Mr. Yardeni had been more pessimistic than most economists; few analysts expected an actual recession this year. But many forecasters are beginning to wonder if their earlier predictions weren't a shade too gloomy. Recent statistics -- notably, employment, new orders and industrial production -- indicate the new year may be getting off to a faster-than-expected start."The strong employment gains in January show that the economic rebound has developed a good deal of momentum," says Sam Nakagama, a New York-based economic consultant. Non-farm payroll employment rose a sharp 448,000 last month after increasing 225,000 in December.Robert Genetski, an economist at Chicago's Harris Trust & Savings Bank, says, "The latest economic numbers show a burst of activity toward year end. In the final three months of the year, industrial production, personal income and wages and salaries rose at close to a 6% annual rate. Perhaps of greater significance is the surge in manufacturers' new orders, which suggests future strength. In December these orders, excluding defense, jumped 10% from their levels of last summer and fall."Mr. Genetski expects the inflation-adjusted gross national product to grow at a 3.6% annual rate in the current quarter, a sharp rise from the 1.7% rate in the fourth quarter. Other factors influencing Mr. Genetski and other optimists: rapid growth of the money supply, a belief that the trade deficit will continue to shrink, and the help that higher oil prices will give the U.S. oil industry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Federal Reserve is having trouble tying up the loose ends of its $1.25 trillion program to buy mortgage-backed securities, prompting an announcement Monday that it would buy different bonds than planned.The Fed said it hasn't been able to complete the last $9.2 billion worth of deals to buy 5.5% 30-year bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because the debt is in such short supply. Instead, the Fed said it would buy other securities with lower nominal interest rates.The 5.5% notes are now so scarce that would-be sellers -- financial institutions called primary dealers -- are struggling to find enough of them to hand over to the Fed. Many are failing to deliver them.The Fed's dilemma shows just how tight the mortgage market has become -- fewer mortgages are being made, resulting in fewer mortgage-backed bonds being created. Tighter supply, however, has helped drive up prices by 3% to 4% on the 5.5 coupons securities; under the purchase agreements those gains belong to taxpayers.While the Fed ended its 15-month program to buy mortgage-backed securities at the end of March, several deals were designed to close this summer. Some of the buying was made in the forward market, so the agreement was set before the program ended, but the securities didn't have to be delivered until later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Investors hoping that index funds will give Facebook Inc.'s battered shares a lift could be in for a long wait.When the Nasdaq Stock Market decided in April to shorten the "seasoning" period for any stock to three months from as little as a year, it made the social-networking company, which went public in May, eligible for inclusion in its Nasdaq-100 index as soon as Sept. 1.Changes to indexes, known as "rebalancing," are closely followed by traders, as additions mean that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that explicitly replicate them are forced to buy the stock, regardless of its performance. Many funds that are benchmarked against an index buy as well.But any uplift from joining the Nasdaq-100, which includes Internet and technology giants such as Apple Inc., Google Inc. and Baidu Inc., is likely to be months away. Although Facebook's stock-market value, at $52 billion, should easily qualify it as one of the 100 largest Nasdaq-listed companies, the index is only reranked each December.Surprise additions do happen--but it is only when a company leaves the index because it falls below listings requirements, seeks bankruptcy protection or is acquired, that unscheduled changes are made.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON--The number of contracts signed to buy previously-owned homes slipped in June, a sign the housing recovery remains choppy despite a retreat in interest rates.An index of pending home sales, reflecting purchases under contract but not yet closed, fell 1.1% to a reading of 102.7 in June from May, ending three months of gains, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. The above-100 reading indicates market activity was still "average," if not robust, the trade group said.Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.5% rise in June sales.Compared with a year ago, pending-home sales were down 7.3% last month. That suggests many Americans remain unwilling or unable to enter the market despite historically low borrowing costs and a pickup in job creation. Lenders are still imposing strict lending standards, and home prices have risen sharply over the past two years. Meanwhile, Americans' incomes are growing tepidly.Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said sales conditions have improved since the winter as price gains have eased and more homes have come on the market. "However, supply shortages still exist in parts of the country, wages are flat, and tight credit conditions are deterring a higher number of potential buyers from fully taking advantage of lower interest rates," Mr. Yun said in a statement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Losing a job for the first time can be an anxiety-laden milestone for twentysomethings. But it can also be an opportunity to rethink your course, and possibly make changes, before you've proceeded very far on a career path.A job loss in March was a "bittersweet" experience for 27-year-old Erin Suhy, who had been working as a development assistant for a nonprofit organization. "I lost income and the potential to work in a field that I respect," she says, but "the job wasn't challenging and it made me miserable."Since then, the New York resident has worked on and off doing administrative work and is currently collecting unemployment insurance while considering post-graduate certificate programs in Web design. She's also thinking about moving. "This time has given me the opportunity to think about what I really want out of life," she says.However, the worst part of being unemployed is feeling insecure, she says, and constantly wondering "am I making the right decisions?"Twentysomethings often agonize over every career move. "They feel like their choice has to be momentous," says Larry Root, a professor of social work at the University of Michigan. And when a job doesn't work out, he says, it "can be hard psychologically," leading to low self-esteem, mental stress and feelings of inadequacy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The risk of currency forecasting is nowhere more apparent then in the foreign-exchange trading rooms of the nation's leading banks.A vast majority of these banks bet the U.S. dollar would weaken, or at least stabilize, in the second quarter, after its precipitous rise against other major foreign currencies at the start of the year. Instead, the dollar -- buoyed by the nation's booming economy and high U.S. interest rates that make dollar-denominated investments look especially attractive -- rocketed.Figures released this week by the top seven U.S. banks that have foreign-exchange operations show that forex trading has become an important profit center at many major banks, accounting in some instances for between 5% and 10% of their revenue -- at least in a good year.But four of the seven banks had sizable declines in revenue from foreign-exchange operations in the second quarter. A fifth, J.P. Morgan & Co., had a loss of $12.9 million on foreign-exchange operations, the most sizable by any major bank in the past several years. Only two banks said their second-quarter revenue from foreign-exchange operations had risen.Some of these same banks also had sizable earnings declines on bond-trading operations. Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, for instance, had an overall second-quarter earnings decline of 2% because of problems in both its foreign-exchange and bond-trading operations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a $57 billion-plus agriculture spending bill that would restore money for President Clinton's food-safety initiative and provide $500 million in emergency aid for hardpressed farmers.The Midwest and Texas are two likely beneficiaries of the farm aid, which sailed through on a voice vote and the endorsement of the White House. After days of pounding by Democrats on a growing economic crisis in the Farm Belt, Republican senators appeared to have little will to resist. Even on the food-safety initiative, the GOP split almost evenly in support of the White House's position.Sen. Thad Cochran (R., Miss.), the bill's manager, joined in backing the amendment, adding $66 million for the food-safety program. Most of the money would go to programs within the Food and Drug Administration, and together with what was already in the bill, the White House will get a total of $68 million, or about three-quarters of its request.Final Senate passage last night came as the House narrowly approved a $26.6 billion Treasury bill after a seesaw battle driven by partisan politics -- and the always divisive issue of abortion. Attached to the measure is a precedent-setting provision requiring that health-insurance plans for federal employees provide contraceptive coverage.Antiabortionists have attached similar riders to ban abortion coverage, and the new provision is a major victory for women's rights groups. Beyond the abortion debate, the proposal touches on the issue of gender discrimination in health insurance. Young single women are often forced to bear the price of birth control, and if the contraceptives requirement is enacted for federal-employee health plans, it could have an influence on the entire health-insurance industry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The narrowing of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in November was one of the few positive signals sent recently by an economy widely believed to be entering a downturn.The trade gap narrowed to $9.7 billion from a revised $10.99 billion in October, according to the Commerce Department. However, just as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait swelled the deficit late last summer by driving oil prices up, the war currently raging in the Middle East could lead to another price surge -- and thus widen the trade gap substantially -- if it lasts more than a few weeks.The trade deficit totaled $94.95 billion from January through November, compared with $102.6 billion for the year-before period. The trade deficit for all of 1989 was $109.4 billion. The U.S. hasn't registered a deficit of less than $100 billion since 1983, when the gap was $52.4 billion.Exports in November dropped $1.39 billion, or about 4%, but imports slid $2.68 billion, nearly 6%. Economists attributed the import drop partly to reduced consumer demand amid the economic slowdown. Exports and imports both increased in October, puzzling economists because the economic downturn apparently had begun by then. The October trade deficit originally was reported as $11.61 billion.Despite the November drop, exports generally have been climbing slowly but steadily over the past few years, and trade-deficit figures are quite volatile on a month-to-month basis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- A portrait of the art market after this week would probably contain a greater share of somber hues.Art dealers and art collectors across the country say the wild swings in the stock market may damp some of the euphoria that has characterized the art market in recent years. A number of dealers report that buyers who had paintings on hold or who had planned to purchase paintings are calling to postpone or cancel the deals. And some art experts expect the stratospheric prices that some works have commanded will return to more realistic levels -- just as the important fall auction season is beginning."I think the speculative fever (in art-buying) will subside now," says Lewis Manilow, a Chicago real-estate investor and major art collector. "This (stock market crash) is a dash of realism, and the art world needs some realism, too. It can't be endless."Adds W. Graham Arader III, a print dealer who owns galleries in seven cities: "The art boom is over. It just got too high and it's over." Mr. Arader says he did a brisk business in August, especially to "Forbes 400 people," but that even before the crash, less-affluent collectors had stopped buying. "We did seven antique shows in the past three weeks, and we couldn't sell a thing," he says. "That has me scared."No one expects the art market to collapse in a heap: There is no Dow Jones average that lumps together Louis XIV furniture and Picasso paintings. "Blue chip" art works have historically held their value much better than lower quality pieces in a downturn, and the Van Gogh iris painting set for sale at Sotheby's on Nov. 11 is still expected to fetch about $30 million, the second-highest price ever for a painting. Sotheby's is the auction house unit of London-based Sotheby's Holdings Inc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Investors in the world's major bond markets are having their worst year since the early 1980s, and the final quarter probably won't bring much improvement, money managers and analysts say.A combination of robust world economic growth, higher short-term interest rates and a strengthening dollar against major currencies has turned global fixed-income investing into a minefield. "This has been one ugly year so far and it doesn't look like it's getting any better," says Kenneth Windheim, who manages a $3.5 billion bond portfolio for Prudential Capital Management International.With the exception of Australian, Canadian and high-yield, high-risk U.S. junk bonds, government bond markets proved dismal investments in the nine months ended Sept. 30. A basket of U.S. bonds, for instance, returned only 6%, while West German, Dutch, Japanese, British and French government securities provided negative total returns of 13.22%, 12.19%, 6.79%, 5.18% and 4.56% respectively during the period, according to Salomon Brothers Inc."You'd have to go back to before 1984 to find a year with such poor across-the-board performance," says John Lipsky, a director of international bond market research at Salomon. The returns are measured in U.S. dollars and include price, income and currency changes for bonds with remaining maturities of at least one year.Even some of the savviest money managers in the global bond market took their lumps in the first nine months. "This isn't a market you should be messing around in if you don't know what's going on," says Denis Karnosky, a managing director and head of asset allocation at First Chicago Investment Advisors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>STOCK INVESTORS are tearing out their hair for fear that surging Treasury-bond yields will torpedo the stock market.But not Jim Paulsen. The chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, which oversees $175 billion, figures higher yields are just great for stocks."I've just got a sense of optimism about this thing," Mr. Paulsen says. "If you are a real stock bull, you've got to root for a higher bond yield."That wasn't exactly how the market reacted Friday. Treasury-bond yields affect other interest rates across the economy, including those of fixed-rate mortgages and many corporate loans and bonds. Higher rates put a pinch on consumers and companies alike, and that squeezes profits. When the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped Friday to 4.965%, a level it hadn't seen since June 2002, stocks suffered: The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 96.46 points, or 0.9%, to 11120.04.The fear is that higher yields mark the end of the easy-money era that has been the stock market's prime driver since 2002. Consumers will find it more expensive to buy a home or to take out a home-equity loan and buy a new car. Businesses will find new investment more costly. Investors will have to think twice before tossing more borrowed money into the stock market -- they might even take some out. Bonds and money-market funds, with their higher new rates, will draw money away from stocks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Financial security has rarely looked so unappealing.Bonds and bond mutual funds are supposed to offer a comforting dose of certainty. You typically have an excellent idea of how much interest you will collect each year and what price you will receive when you go to sell.But today, that virtue looks like a vice. Even the longest-dated Treasury bonds pay less than 5%. To make matters worse, many folks fear rising interest rates will pummel bond prices.What to do? In this week's and next week's column, I will offer some pointers on how to navigate 2006's treacherous bond market and how to build a portfolio that should serve you well in the years ahead. Today's contention: The current worries are overblown -- and they certainly shouldn't dissuade you from having at least a portion of your portfolio in bonds.Bonds may be unappealing, but stocks aren't much better. They trade at lofty price/earnings multiples and they pay skimpy dividend yields.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A senior Nasdaq Stock Market executive told customers that the exchange would have put the brakes on Facebook Inc.'s initial public offering had it known the extent of the technical problems that would plague its systems and disrupt the eagerly anticipated listing.Nasdaq's comments came as regulators moved to review the exchange's handling of the listing. They also are examining underwriters Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. over reductions in Facebook's earnings estimates during the IPO roadshow.On a conference call with brokers after Tuesday's close, Eric Noll, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.'s head of transaction services, said the exchange "by no means would have gone forward with a print" had Nasdaq believed there would be problems "in continuous trading." A "print" is industry parlance for the share price that results from the match-up of orders before trading starts, and is the price at which shares start trading on the open market.Mr. Noll suggested Nasdaq had underestimated the technical problems. He said the exchange's early interpretation of problems that delayed trading in Facebook shares by 30 minutes was incorrect. "We thought we had a fix," he said on the call.In comments to The Wall Street Journal following the call, Mr. Noll said, "If we had known that our solution was inadequate, we would have fixed the issue with the right solution before going forward."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dow Jones NewswiresEmboldened by the recent turnaround in auto bonds after General Motors Corp.'s smooth transition to speculative-grade ranking, bondholders responded warmly to rival Ford Motor Credit's first foray into the corporate-bond market since Standard & Poor's lowered its credit ratings to junk in May.The finance arm of Ford Motor Co. sold an unsecured offering of $1.5 billion, increased from $1 billion. Its three-year notes have a coupon of 6.625% at a price of 99.259, for a yield of 6.902%. That amounted to a yield margin of 3.30 percentage points over comparable Treasurys, in line with expectations. UBS and Lehman Brothers were the lead managers on the bond offering."In light of recent events, investors are increasing their risk appetite," said Brian Ropp, an auto analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. "This, and the attractive spread concession on Ford Motor Credit's new issue should see this deal do well," Mr. Ropp added. Spreads are the difference in yield between bonds and comparable U.S. Treasurys paid to investors for owning riskier corporate debt.The $1.5 billion deal garnered around $4 billion in orders from investors, according to one market participant. The deal was put together partly in response to inquiries by investors about an offering from Ford, people familiar with the situation said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Worthen Banking Corp. disclosed that bank regulators view the company's condition as "unsatisfactory" and listed six of its banks as "problem" institutions.Worthen, Arkansas's largest banking company, disclosed that it replaced its longstanding independent accountants last year after a series of disagreements concerning the adequacy of its 1985 loan-loss allowance and disclosure of lawsuits against Worthen, among other things.Worthen, with $2.1 billion assets and 10 banking units, was reviewed by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Arkansas bank regulators. As a result, bank regulators have increased their scrutiny of Worthen by requiring it to submit various written plans, policies and procedures to the St. Louis Fed, including its so-far unsuccessful attempt to name a chairman of the company, its debt-service plans, capital levels and its business plan for the remainder of 1987 and 1988.Moreover, Worthen must enlist an independent management consultant to review its organization and management structure and report back to the St. Louis Fed. Worthen also must either charge off as losses or collect all loans or parts of loans that it classified as losses by last Sept. 30. The regulators examined the condition of the company as of that date.Worthen signed a regulatory agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank last March, and made a brief public announcement of the action at the time. However, it didn't disclose that bank regulators took a dim view of its operations and the "problem" status of seven of its bank units, one of which it sold this year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If sensible treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism were to be offered in every U.S. neighborhood, it also could improve the health of some people who have never touched drugs or taken a drink, and do this more dramatically than any research now in progress. It also could lower medical-care costs more effectively than will all the arbitrary cost-cutting that is now shaving most everyone's medical care down to the grimly skinny. The overdue task is to properly define what sensible substance-abuse treatment is.Given the current obsession with controlling medical-care costs, what's sensible should bear some relation to what's affordable. Yet at the most publicized of alcohol- and drug-abuse treatment centers, the Fair Oaks hospital group (which sponsors the famous 800-COCAINE hotline), the current cost of a hospital day is $1,000, which exceeds the price of a day in the coronary-care unit of Massachusetts General Hospital. The cost of a full inpatient term of treatment at these centers -- four weeks to six months -- ranges from $28,000 to $160,000, with an average of $56,000. This is a spread whose lower end is higher than the cost of bypass surgery and all its attendant expense and whose upper end is more than double the average cost -- $70,000 -- of treating an AIDS patient. Most other middle-class centers cost $10,000 per term of inpatient treatment, while the Betty Ford Center charges $5,000, and Hazelden in Minnesota charges $4,000.The reason no one questions these prices, not even the insurance companies who pay them, is that the alternative expense in addiction-related disease, lost productivity and crime is reckoned at $170 billion a year. With treatment success rates reported as high as 85% to 92% at (for instance) the Fair Oaks hospital group, the treatment prices have appeared eminently cost-effective, and the success rates miles ahead of those recorded over the past 50 years by public substance-abuse programs. The hitch, according to Dr. Chad Emrick of the University of Colorado (the only researcher to review all the literature on this subject), is that those success rates are more fantasy than fact. Both Dr. Emrick and Dr. George Vaillant, professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School, say that, even when addressed in these same expensive treatment centers, alcoholism and drug abuse remain notoriously prone to relapse -- which confuses the meaning of "success." Many of those treated need retreatment two or three or more times.Given prices of $160,000 or $56,000 or even $4,000 per term of treatment, how can we afford care for those who are habitual and excessive users of drugs and/or alcohol? There are an estimated 40 million people who regularly abuse these substances. Were all of them to be treated only once at even the lowest-priced outpatient center (Hazelden, at $1,800 per term of treatment) the cost would be on the order of $72 billion. That's one-fifth of annual current medical expenses in the U.S. If, against high odds, half of these heavy users could break their habits by themselves, the remainder would still cost some $36 billion to treat -- once. What is the answer?To begin with, Drs. Emrick and Vaillant and others have not found a scintilla of evidence to show that expensive treatment works any more effectively than less expensive kinds. Mr. Vaillant, author of the classic book "The Natural History of Alcoholism," says, "What's important is that treatment be available for everyone as often as they need it." On just this precept, the Cambridge and Somerville Program for Alcohol Recovery in Massachusetts, developed by Harvard Medical School physicians, has for the past 16 years treated about 20,000 patients a year at an annual cost of $1 million. Its bywords are easy accessibility and versatility of approach. The program includes a 24-hour walk-in clinic, outpatient groups, groups for families, women's groups, a detoxification unit and three halfway houses. It boasts no amazing statistics or new wonder therapies, but in its humdrum and unpretentious way it weans a great many people from their injurious addictions, some permanently, others only for a while at a time. Its "success" rate, in short, is as good as any.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Forecasters surveyed quarterly by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia expect the economy to grow faster this year than they did previously, but they don't expect inflation to be any worse this year.The median of the 37 forecasts is for the U.S. economy to expand at an annual rate of 3.2% in the current quarter, 2.8% in the third quarter and 2.7% in the fourth; three months ago, they were predicting inflation-adjusted growth rates of 2.7%, 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively.After a hiccup in consumer prices in the current quarter because of higher oil prices, the economists expect consumer-price inflation to calm to a 2.1% pace in 1999 and rise slightly to 2.3% in 2000, the same as they did in a February survey. Over the next decade, the forecasters expect 2.5% annual increases in the consumer-price index.But the Philadelphia Fed cautioned that two-thirds of the new forecasts were received before the government reported a surprisingly sharp increase in the CPI in April.As they have in previous surveys, the forecasters said they expect the year 2000 computer glitch to increase inflation-adjusted growth by an average of 0.3 percentage point this year and shave 0.3 point off growth early next year. As a result, the forecasters expect the economy to slow to a 1.8% growth rate in the first quarter of 2000 and then to rebound to a 3.0% pace in the second.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to conventional wisdom among economists and policy makers, Americans do not save enough. The suggested remedies include tax incentives for saving and policies ensuring that government programs, such as Social Security, do not discourage saving. But Americans save more than many believe, and in any case, future generations will be better off than the current ones even if saving does not increase.It is true that by official measures, U.S. net national saving has been low, by both historical and international standards. For a decade at least, the high measured saving rates in Japan were cited to explain why Japanese economic growth was so much greater than the U.S.'s. Japan still has a higher saving rate, but its growth has stopped. Most developed economies would be envious of the U.S.'s 4% economic growth rate and its unemployment rate of less than 5%. It seems a bad bargain to change places with Japan, or any of the other nations with purportedly higher saving rates.But by appropriate measures, the U.S. saving rate is not really so low. The official measure of net national saving begins with gross saving, which has been rising. Gross saving reached 17.3% of gross domestic product in 1997. To calculate the net saving, usually viewed as national saving, one must subtract depreciation or "consumption of fixed capital." This brings the rate of net national saving down to $555 billion, or 6.5% of GDP. That $555 billion would add about 2.8% to the current net stock of tangible capital, public and private. Thus it implies a growth in capital somewhat higher than commonly forecast long-run growth rate of the economy.Even this net rate might not be an adequate measure of growth in a period of rapid technological advance. The depreciated capital might be replaced by more productive new capital, so that even without adding to the measure of net capital stock the capacity for growth would increase. A better perspective could be gained by looking at real gross domestic investment, private and public. That total, financed in part by foreign net investment equal to 2% of our GDP, comes to 19.5% of GDP.This higher real percentage reflects the falling price of much investment, particularly in computers; relatively more investment goods than consumption goods are being bought for each dollar. The net real domestic investment of $592 billion (1992 dollars) in 1997 was thus 8.2% of real GDP, suggesting that real capital stock was growing even more rapidly relative to real output.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporters of The Wall Street JournalFriday's report that April unemployment jumped to 5.8% from 5.5% was viewed by some investors as a sign that the Fed may have raised interest rates so high that the economy could stall later this year. That would put heavy pressure on corporate earnings, the driver of the bull market rally that has seen stock prices post a series of new highs recently.Most economists, however, say they believe it's premature for investors to start worrying that a recession is near and say that investors may be overreacting to recent economic indicators."There's no question that in the last couple of days more and more people have begun considering that maybe the soft-landing is going to be a hard landing," says Ed Nicoski, chief market strategist at Piper Jaffray. "Two days of market action doesn't offer enough evidence for a meaningful conclusion, but the thinking has certainly shifted."After a relentless six-month rally in which major averages gained nearly 20%, stock prices have stumbled in the past two sessions. The declines have been relatively modest, but they come in stark contrast to a powerful bond market rally during the same two sessions. Long-term interest rates have now dropped to 7.025% as bond bulls cheer the steep slowdown reflected in recent economic data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>California, birthplace of the high-technology boom that helped carry the nation's economy to new heights, is also setting the national standard for layoffs. But the Midwest, bogged down in a manufacturing slowdown, is catching up quickly.Those are among the highlights of a report released yesterday by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics on so-called mass layoffs, where companies terminate 50 or more employees at once, and the employees file for unemployment insurance. The report indicated that while mass layoffs started 2000 little changed from a year earlier, layoffs rose 54% for the fourth quarter from a year earlier as a slowing economy prompted big companies to make sharp cuts in their work forces. In the October to December period, there were 5,248 mass-layoff events involving 647,012 workers, compared with 3,943 events and 420,827 workers a year earlier.For the entire year, there were 15,738 mass-layoff events affecting 1.84 million workers, compared with 14,909 events affecting 1.57 million in 1999. Not surprisingly, the largest percentage of the job cuts occurred in manufacturing, which accounted for 35% of all layoff events and 42% of all workers."Virtually everyone has been willing to admit that the manufacturing sector is miserable; the question now is whether that weakness spreads out to other areas of the economy," said Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney.The distribution of mass layoffs on a state-by-state basis showed some surprising results. Partly as a result of an unfolding energy crisis, declining sales of technology equipment and the dot-com blowout, California reported nearly 155,000 mass layoffs for the fourth quarter, a 14% jump from a year earlier. The state also has seen huge job losses in the motion-picture and agriculture industries, although those industries are seasonal and experience heavy turnover.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In recent times, most economists have pretended that the economy is essentially predictable and understandable. Economic decision- and policy-making in the private and public sectors, the thinking goes, can be reduced to a science. Today we are seeing consequences of this conceit in the financial industries and central banking. "Financial engineering" and "rule-based" monetary policy, by considering uncertain knowledge to be certain knowledge, are taking us in a hazardous direction.Predictability was not always the economic fashion. In the 1920s, Frank Knight at the University of Chicago viewed the capitalist economy as shot through with "unmeasurable" risks, which he called "uncertainty." John Maynard Keynes wrote of the consequences of Knightian uncertainty for rational action.Friedrich Hayek began a movement to bring key points of uncertainty theory into the macroeconomics of employment -- a modernist movement later resumed when Milton Friedman and I started the "micro foundations of macro" in the 1960s.In the 1970s, though, a new school of neo-neoclassical economists proposed that the market economy, though noisy, was basically predictable. All the risks in the economy, it was claimed, are driven by purely random shocks -- like coin throws -- subject to known probabilities, and not by innovations whose uncertain effects cannot be predicted.This model took hold in American economics and soon practitioners sought to apply it. Quantitative finance theory became a tool relied on by most banks and hedge funds. Policy rules based on this model were adopted at the Federal Reserve and other central banks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DETROIT -- For the first time in years, the U.S. auto industry is starting to pay attention to the price of gasoline.Although inflation-adjusted prices at the pump remain near historic lows, a 31% jump this year, to an average $1.35 a gallon in November, sounded a warning bell for the auto industry that buyers could put fresh emphasis on fuel efficiency. That isn't likely to threaten what's expected to be a record-breaking year of auto sales in the U.S. in 1999, but it could ease demand for sport-utility vehicles, which are among the least fuel-efficient vehicles.Sport-utility vehicles have nearly doubled their share of U.S. sales, to 18% this year from just under 10% in 1994, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter. More important for auto makers, profits from SUVs are huge, while small cars remain loss leaders.The big question for the industry is whether gasoline prices will rise high enough -- and stay there long enough -- to spook many buyers into shifting to more fuel-efficient vehicles. In the long term, the industry could respond to such demand with a raft of technologies that it is developing, from advanced internal-combustion engines to hybrid power plants that use electric power to cut fuel consumption. In the short term, however, renewed consumer consciousness about fuel efficiency could slow sales of SUVs.James Holden, president of DaimlerChrysler AG's U.S. arm, which depends for much of its profits on sales of SUVs such as the Dodge Durango, says he expects average U.S. gasoline prices to rise to about $1.50 a gallon and stay there for a couple months. If prices rise much higher than that and stay there long, they "would cause some shift" in consumer demand to smaller trucks, he figures. But he doesn't see gasoline prices rising to a point where consumers would trade trucks for small cars. "It's not going to get people to sell the Durango and the boat they tow," he says.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As the U.S. economy inches toward the "fiscal cliff," the country's small banks are approaching a cliff of their own, in a development that could pinch short-term lending rates.On Jan. 1, a program that insures an unlimited amount of money in non-interest-bearing accounts will expire unless Washington moves to extend it. Without the Transaction Account Guarantee program, or TAG, an insurance cap resets to $250,000, affecting about $1.6 trillion in deposits.And without insurance protection, depositors may be compelled to move amounts above $250,000 to other venues deemed safer, leaving the banks with less business.J.P. Morgan estimates that, of that total, $579 billion could be on the move.Big financial firms would be on the receiving end of these flows, where cash would either be moved into the perceived safer hands of larger banks or earn a sliver of interest at a conservative money fund. Safety is a big concern for investors as the federal government faces the potential "fiscal cliff," a set of tax increases and spending cuts that kick in on Jan. 1 if lawmakers can't reach a compromise plan, and which could send the economy into recession.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If the U.S. economy keeps growing like it is, Rodney Dangerfield is going to have to rise from the dead and file a patent claim. The expansion that gets no respect keeps cruising along -- past $70 oil, above rising interest rates, and now apparently around even the housing and auto slumps.Yesterday's report that fourth quarter GDP rose a healthy 3.5% was merely the most recent repudiation of the media and Beltway bears who have predicted a recession in each of the past four years. The latest scare came last fall, as the decline in housing accelerated and many of Wall Street's Keynesian forecasters predicted the consumer would slump along with it. (We hope someone offered smelling salts to the economists at Goldman Sachs yesterday.)To the contrary, the consumer remains confident, clocking in with a strong 4.4% spending growth rate in the quarter. Clearly the strong job market and rising wage levels are offsetting any fear among consumers that their home values have flattened or fallen. Without housing and autos, real GDP rose 5.8%.At the same time, U.S. exports are booming, as growth elsewhere accelerates. Exports rose 10% in the quarter and a very robust 9.2% for the year, adding 1.64 percentage points to GDP growth. By the way, exports to China alone rose by more than 30% in the first 11 months of last year, even without a major change in China's policy to peg the yuan closely to the U.S. dollar. Members of Congress pounded Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson yesterday for not doing enough to get China to revalue the yuan, but maybe China's growing economy is more important for American exporters than devaluing the greenback. Just a thought.The most bullish economists yesterday also hailed the GDP report's inflation signals, which were muted. But we're not convinced the current inflation cycle has played itself out -- not with gold back near $650 an ounce, commodities in general rising again and the dollar weak. For its part, the Federal Reserve held its target fed funds rate at 5.25% yesterday, but played inflation down the middle. "Inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, its statement said, but "some inflation risks remain." In other words, they have no idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The January bounce.Trying to catch it is a favorite pastime of small investors. It is also a game two of the contestants in this month's stock-picking contest want to play.Traditionally, certain stocks that have declined during the year get hammered further in December, as investors wishing to soothe their investment pain sell to record a tax loss. Stocks issued by small companies are usually most affected, and many of them bounce back in January like rubber balls.This is the stock market's celebrated "January effect." It isn't a sure thing. Some years it doesn't happen at all, and some years much of the bounce happens in late December. But it happens often enough to be part of Wall Street lore and investment strategy.Betting on a January bounce in this month's stock-picking contest are two money managers: Lois Burleigh, director of equity investments for ASB Capital Management Inc. in Washington, D.C., and Randall Ely, president of Edgar Lomax Co. in Alexandria, Va.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The same "fundamentally flawed" system of financial rules that failed in 2008 lives on, "but with more complexity" in the latest proposals from regulators.That was the blunt message on Friday from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Director Thomas Hoenig. He was talking about the pending implementation of international bank capital standards known as Basel III. And thank goodness Mr. Hoenig is not the only voice of sanity in the regulatory wilderness.On we told you about the Bank of England's Andrew Haldane, who has shown that in many cases Basel's expensive, complicated regulations do actual harm by obscuring the true condition of big banks. Mr. Haldane's call for simplicity struck a chord with readers. A few of their appear nearby.Not that Journal readers ever expected a convention of global bureaucrats in a Swiss village to protect U.S. taxpayers. But Mr. Hoenig did a public service at an American Banker symposium by reviewing the relevant history from 2008: "It turns out that the Basel capital rules protected no one: not the banks, not the public, and certainly not the FDIC that bore the cost of the failures or the taxpayers who funded the bailouts. The complex Basel rules hurt, rather than helped the process of measurement and clarity of information."Observing a Basel system that only grows more complicated as U.S. regulators prepare to implement the latest version, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City also pointed out that the biggest winners from such regulatory regimes are never the little guys. Mr. Hoenig explained that "the most brazen and connected banks with the smartest experts will game the system. In private discussions, I find a good deal of uneasiness about Basel III's ability to be more effective than previous Basel efforts; however, there is a sense that we cannot go back."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Former President Bush said in a television interview that he blames Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan for his 1992 defeat."I think that if the interest rates had been lowered more dramatically that I would have been re-elected president because the [economic] recovery that we were in would have been more visible," Mr. Bush told interviewer David Frost. "I reappointed him, and he disappointed me."Mr. Bush's economic advisers, particularly Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, were critical of the Greenspan Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates more rapidly during the recession of 1990-91 and the sluggish recovery that followed.Mr. Greenspan, a Republican, was appointed by President Reagan in 1987, and nominated for another term in July 1991 by Mr. Bush, partly because he couldn't find an acceptable alternative. He was reappointed by President Clinton to a term that ends in 2000.A spokesman for Mr. Greenspan declined to comment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FRANKFURT--European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door to an escalation in the central bank's efforts to battle the debt crisis, hinting that the bank would be willing, under certain conditions, to intervene more forcefully in financial markets.Mr. Draghi stopped short of promising unlimited purchases of euro-zone bonds, as a number of European policy makers have recently demanded, but his comments nevertheless signal that the ECB is willing to do more.In his first appearance before the European Parliament since taking the ECB helm last month, Mr. Draghi offered a road map for policy makers and investors as Europe's debt crisis reaches a critical phase next week, when the ECB has its monthly meeting and European leaders hold another crisis summit.His call to politicians: Enact tough new rules to punish fiscal rule-breakers and follow through on pledges to pursue deficit-cutting measures. Mr. Draghi signaled the ECB is willing to help, if governments deliver."He ruled out a swift type of approach, but at least he has told the markets if these two things are being done [by governments], then he won't let market confidence deteriorate too much. I thought it was quite well done," said Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Investors celebrating the new bull market's first birthday on Tuesday may remember a less happy milestone on Wednesday: the 10-year anniversary of the peak of the technology-stock bubble.The great debate among stock-market analysts these days is whether the market has finally worked off years of excessive prices and can return to steady growth.Optimists argue that two brutal bear markets have left stocks cheap and attractive, especially if the government's economic-recovery initiatives succeed. They say investors who were too optimistic in the 1990s are too pessimistic now, and that a recovery in corporate performance could offer investors happy surprises.But some of those who warned of trouble a decade ago are worried again today. They say government interventions in the economy and the market in 1998, 2001 and 2008 kept stocks from fully correcting. Some see signs of bubbles starting to inflate again, notably in certain developing-country stocks.This uncertainty has fueled a prolonged debate between two old friends, renowned economists Robert Shiller and Jeremy Siegel. They say they've been chewing over the issue during vacations together at the New Jersey shore. Mr. Shiller, a Yale University professor whose book "Irrational Exuberance" warned of the tech bubble just before it burst in 2000, still worries about the market's future. Prof. Siegel of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, whose book "Stocks for the Long Run" was the bible for many investors in the 1990s, is bullish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The volatile stock market may provide all the risk that most investors can stomach, but some Wall Street investment banks are making much more daring bets: pumping venture capital into fledgling Internet companies whose initial public offerings may be years away.Traditionally, Wall Street's leaders have avoided venture investing, leaving it to specialized boutiques that raise money from universities, wealthy individuals and others. But with many venture funds lately earning 50% or more a year, securities industry heavyweights such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. are pushing their capital into venture investments ranging from biotechnology to telecommunications.Some of the most hectic action involves tiny, money-losing Internet enterprises that investment bankers hope will be the next Yahoo! Inc. or Amazon.com Inc.Executives of closely held Internet companies are watching this stampede with delight. In May, Ross Garber, chairman of Vignette Corp., came to New York to raise $7 million of venture-capital equity for his Austin, Texas, Internet-software company. After huddling with Goldman, Morgan Stanley and three other firms, Mr. Garber realized his sights were too low."We ended up raising $14.3 million, including $10 million from the investment banks, and we could have gone much higher," Mr. Garber says. "I had bankers calling me at home on weekends, threatening my future livelihood if I didn't let them in for a bigger stake."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Credit-ratings firms say they plan to delay issuing any credit-rating downgrades to the largest U.S. banks as a result of new financial regulation.Moody's Investors Service analysts on Thursday said that, under the overhaul bill passed by the Senate last month, the government still has some room to bail out the biggest banks, at least in the short term -- an option it will likely choose as long as the economy and markets are unsettled."Consequently, we expect that the senior debt and deposit ratings of systemically important banks in the U.S. will continue to benefit from unusual levels of support," Moody's analysts wrote in a report, "until the economic recovery is sustained, financial market health is restored, and the risks of attempting to unwind an interconnected institution are reduced."Moody's didn't specify which banks it considers systemically important, but the short list likely includes Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley.The Moody's Corp. unit and McGraw-Hill Cos.' Standard & Poor's in the past have warned that the government's implied support of banks considered to big to fail means they get higher credit ratings than they otherwise would, usually between one and five notches.

    <TEXT>Dome Petroleum Ltd. said its continued existence depends on implementation of a recently proposed interim debt-deferral arrangement, unless oil prices rise or interest rates or taxes decline.The Calgary, Alberta-based oil company, in a 10-K annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said it intends to implement the interim plan May 1 whether or not its 56 lenders agree. Dome said it will approach its lenders to develop a permanent plan before the interim one expires June 30, 1987.The company warned that failure to reach an overall agreement, or at least waivers or extensions on its debt obligations, could lead to a default. That in turn could result in lenders demanding immediate payment of as much as $5.9 billion (Canadian) of Dome's long-term debt.In the SEC filing, Dome also disclosed that it may have to write down the value of its oil and gas reserves as a result of falling oil prices. Although it doesn't use U.S. accounting rules, Dome said that under such rules it might face a $1 billion (Canadian) charge using a crude oil price of $14 a barrel as the value of its reserves.Dome said a write-down might also be required under Canadian accounting rules, but it declined to discuss the possible size. It also said a write-down might be needed if recent oil-price declines are determined to be "other than temporary," and if there aren't any compensating changes in other factors used in the calculation of future net revenue. Such a determination would be made "in consultation with its petroleum consulting engineers," Dome said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co. reported an 8.6% increase in third-quarter earnings as "longer cycle" businesses offset softness in other areas.The electrical and consumer products, broadcasting and financial services concern said net income rose to $1.03 billion, or $1.16 a share, from $945 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.2% to $14.2 billion from $13 billion.Per-share earnings were up 12%, partly reflecting purchases by the company of 12 million of its shares during the quarter. GE had 878 million shares outstanding Sept. 30, compared with 906.4 million a year earlier. GE has bought back 35 million shares since its share-purchase program began in November.GE Chairman John F. Welch Jr. termed the performance "good" in spite of a weakening economy and the Mideast crisis, which he said slowed such lines as plastics, lighting and appliances. Those are known as GE's "shorter cycle" businesses, as contrasted to "longer cycle" lines such as aircraft engines, medical systems and power generation. The chairman also said the GE Appliance unit was able to compensate for the sales softness with productivity gains.Mr. Welch said that despite considerable uncertainty in the U.S. economy, GE "expects 1990 to be the fourth straight year of a double-digit increase in earnings per share."</TEXT>

When Fed officials indicated that they could start trimming the stimulus in a matter of months, the selling began. The market slide ended after a succession of Fed officials made forceful statements that they won't do anything until the economy is strong enough.Lately, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said he doesn't know when the Fed will begin to move: It will depend on the data.In effect, he has pushed the problem into the future.

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration is weighing a plan to force more companies to give workers advance notice before closing plants.A draft document outlining the proposal is circulating around Capitol Hill as part of the Labor Department's "dislocated worker" plan, which proposes transforming the unemployment-insurance system into a broader job training and career counseling program.Since its enactment in 1988, the plant-closing law has been a flop. Officially, it requires corporations to provide 60 days notice any time they furlough a third or more of the full-time workers at any site of at least 150 workers, or if they cut 500 employees at any facility. Notice also is required for any permanent plant closure that affects 50 workers.But whole sectors of corporate America have shuttered plants over the past several years without ever telling workers of their impending fate. In a study of the law, the General Accounting Office earlier this year said about half the plant closings were exempt from the law because of size. The GAO said that of the remaining plants, about half didn't provide enough notice or any at all.The GAO said much of the failure stemmed from companies' lack of knowledge about the provisions of the law. And no government entity currently has the power to enforce the law.</TEXT>

They also could decide to shift the proceeds into mortgage- backed securities rather than long-term Treasury bonds.Among other choices: launching a new round of bond-buying, known to some as quantitative easing, to expand the central bank's portfolio of assets. Or they could alter the way they describe their plans for interest rates with an assurance that short-term interest rates will stay near zero beyond 2014.Policy makers also could stand pat but offer assurance that they stand ready to act if the economy gets weaker.With the exception of standing pat, all these moves would be aimed at bringing down long-term interest rates and reducing credit costs more broadly to spur spending and investment.</TEXT>

"If you work effectively, there's something in it for you," Ms. Wise says. "That {incentive} wasn't always there before."But three of 24 colleagues in her office weren't pleased at all. Although the office achieved 100% of its incentive-plan goals in the first quarter of this year, the three, including a man who had worked there for more than 20 years, didn't get any bonus money at all because their individual performance lagged behind the group's. That long-time employee eventually left the company, Ms. Wise says.Pay-for-performance can be ruthless, but it is nonetheless one of the hottest management and labor trends around, according to compensation consulting firms. Under such plans, middle- or lower-level workers are supposed to be judged as their high-powered executive bosses often are, receiving higher raises, bonuses or prizes for excelling on a variety of specific and often computerized measurement indexes. Employees who don't measure up receive little or no pay raise, or are even fired.A recent survey of 600 companies by Hay Management Consultants found that one-third intend to push pay-for-performance down the corporate ladder; about 11% currently do so. Another survey, by Hewitt Associates, finds a surprising surge in the use of incentive bonuses for all sorts of workers.</TEXT>

When the Alhadeffs bought their $70,000 starter home in the brand-new Oakbrook Station subdivision in 1984, it was as much an investment as a place to live. The nearby hum of route I-85 didn't bother them much; it was only a matter of time before Mr. Alhadeff's accounting job would lead to a top finance position and they'd buy a bigger house in a better neighborhood. Ms. Alhadeff didn't bother to read the local paper. After all, they'd be moving on soon.But now, two corporate cutbacks and a real-estate slump later, the Alhadeffs are stuck. They're in the same house, which is worth roughly the same amount. Mr. Alhadeff, 37, is earning the same income, selling insurance. And Ms. Alhadeff, 41, is trying to accept that they might be marooned in Oakbrook Station for some time. A "For Sale" sign is stashed in their garage."To expect that we're going to have this, and in five years that, and in 10 years this -- maybe it doesn't make sense," says Ms. Alhadeff.The Alhadeffs were among millions of people who gambled on booming suburbs like Gwinnett County as the ideal places to advance their lives. The 1980s saw an explosion of such communities, like Tyson's Corner near Washington, D.C.; Aurora, near Denver; Plano, near Dallas; and Contra Costa, near San Francisco.</TEXT>

House prices would have to fall further if the adjustment took place more quickly.The study tracks rents and home prices back to 1960 and found annual rents fluctuated at around 5% to 5.25% of home prices until 1995. At the end of that year, the average monthly rent was about $553 (or about $6,600 a year) and the average home price was about $134,000.But starting in 1996, home prices started to grow much more rapidly than rents. By the end of 2006, they had more than doubled to an average of $282,000, while the average rent had risen 48% to $818. That drove the annual rent/price ratio down to 3.48%.That means the rent/price ratio is about a third below its long-term average. To return to normal would require some combination of falling prices and rising rents. The paper suggests house prices would need to fall about 3% a year, if rents grew in line with their 4% average annual growth this decade.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The bond market rallied yesterday amid expectations that lackluster economic growth will induce the Federal Reserve to push interest rates lower in coming months.Prices of some Treasury bonds rose about three-quarters of a point, or around $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Interest rates declined at the Treasury's weekly auction of short-term bills."More people are becoming convinced that the economy is weak and that the Fed will lower the discount rate," said Elliott Platt, senior vice president and economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. He predicted the Fed will cut the discount rate to 5% by mid-February to try to bolster economic activity. The discount rate, currently 5 1/2%, is the fee charged by the Fed on loans to banks and savings institutions.Mr. Platt estimated that the economy is growing at an annual rate of only about 2 1/2% this quarter, compared with a 2.9% rate in the third quarter, after inflation. He expects a still lower 1 1/2% growth rate in next year's first quarter.Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc., agreed that the economy "is softening" and that the central bank will ease credit early next year. Business activity will expand at a lethargic 2% annual rate in 1987's first quarter, he predicted. That won't be enough to satisfy Fed officials, who he said would prefer a rate closer to 3%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oil companies and tanker owners will take their longstanding feud over responsibility for oil spills to a diplomatic conference that starts today in London.The goal of the month-long conference of the International Maritime Organization is to update treaties adopted in 1969 and 1971 that set limits on the liability of oil companies and shippers for oil-spill cleanup and damages costs.Shipowners and oil companies had expected the accords to cover the cleanup costs of even the largest oil spills. But inflation, increased tanker sizes and bigger oil-spill damages have since forced the maritime organization to consider raising the maximum liability, which currently is $50 million for each oil spill.Of that amount, shipowners are liable for up to $17 million in damages from oil spills. If cleanup costs exceed that, the oil companies, through a collective fund, are responsible for the rest, up to a maximum of $33 million.Although both sides agree that the overall amount of liability should be increased, each wants the other to bear a greater share of oil-cleanup costs. Shippers complain that they end up paying for most oil spills. But the oil companies contend that with more oil spills exceeding the $17 million limit that shippers are responsible for, oil companies are taking on a greater share of the cleanup costs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You might think that the very first thing the American taxpayer has the right to expect from a financial institution dedicated to maintaining monetary cooperation and the international balance of payments would be some honest bookkeeping. Especially when Uncle Sam is its largest contributor.Think again.Forget about looking for the answer in the U.S. budget. America's contribution to the International Monetary Fund is an off-budget item. And Congress has long preferred to pretend that the billions of dollars in loans that the U.S. makes to the Fund cost the U.S. taxpayer, as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin put it in 1998, "not one dime." Naturally, this line of thinking is just fine with the IMF, which is happy to avoid the closer scrutiny that would be sure to follow if Congress ever admitted that its U.S. funding is not cost- free.Though such logic (not to mention such arithmetic) was always suspect, a new study shows just how flawed it really is. The U.S. contribution to the IMF, says Adam Lerrick of the Gailliot Center at Carnegie Mellon University, has cost the U.S. an average of $1.5 billion a year since 1991. This year those costs will reach $1.9 billion. It sure would be nice if Congress noticed.Mr. Lerrick reaches his conclusions using a set of facts that are difficult to argue with. Start with the fact the Fund makes large loans at low interest rates to such risky economies as Argentina or Indonesia or Russia -- countries that aren't like to repay soon (if ever).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Rhiannon HoyleThe price of gold is back at record levels. But whether it can hit $1,500 in the next few months could depend on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks with an ultraeasy monetary policy that is pushing down the dollar.Right now, the Fed appears divided over the outlook for its quantitative easing program, known to the market at QE2 and scheduled to end on June 30, and the possibility of higher interest rates later this year, even if U.S. unemployment remains high.Any fresh signs that the Fed remains concerned about the U.S. economy would boost gold, which is seen as an alternative currency and often attracts strong interest in times of economic uncertainty and unusually low or negative interest rates after adjusting for inflation, as is the case now. An even stronger signal for gold could come from an extension of the Fed's program beyond June, which for now, at least, seems likely.But any move by the Fed to exit quantitative easing or raise interest rates faster than analysts expect would be detrimental for gold prices, which has come to rely on the U.S.'s super-loose policy. Prices may also come under pressure as investors adjust to life after QE2 and react to any signs that the U.S. economic recovery is gaining traction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For months, pessimistic bond markets and optimistic central bankers have been in a tug of war over where the world economy is headed. A renewed plunge in long-term interest rates world-wide suggests the pessimists are winning.Government bond yields in the U.S., the euro zone and Asia have all fallen sharply in recent weeks, fed by a diet of disappointing economic data, lackluster business investment and -- in a new development yesterday -- hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon take a break from raising interest rates.The decline in long-term interest rates mystifies central bankers -- even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. They see creeping inflation risks and a still-robust outlook for the global economy outside of Europe. And they're increasingly concerned that low long-term rates are also fueling an unsustainable surge in housing prices.Prices of 10-year Treasury bonds jumped yesterday and yields, which move in the opposite direction, tumbled to 3.89%, from 4% Tuesday. That's the lowest since March last year, before the first of the Fed's eight quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increases. The drop came after Richard Fisher, new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said that the Fed is in the "eighth inning" of raising rates, suggesting he believed an increase by the Fed later this month might be its last. Investors expect the Fed to boost its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.25% from 3% at its meeting on June 29 to June 30.Mr. Fisher's comments are at odds with those of other Fed officials who have emphasized that interest rates are still too low to ensure low inflation. But his remarks reinforced a view of many bond traders and a few economists that economic growth in the U.S. is slowing and inflation is ebbing, both of which will lead the Fed to take a pause from raising rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rail workers struck Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., the regional railroad company that last year weathered a strike in an effort to free itself from costly work rules.Striking members of the United Transportation Union blamed the walkout on unsafe conditions. But F. Colin Pease, a vice president of Guilford, said the union is protesting the company's recent attempts to make significant improvements in labor productivity.Although North Billerica, Mass.-based Guilford operates mainly in New England and is closely held, it has become a pioneer on labor issues. It has launched a campaign to confront the railroad industry's archaic, inefficient work practices and to change federal laws that perpetuate them.When track workers struck Guilford in March 1986, the railroad assigned supervisors and nonunion employees to run trains with smaller crews and without expensive work rules. President Reagan two months later created an emergency board to look into the strike, but Congress imposed a settlement favorable to labor.Guilford has since made other efficiency moves. Despite fierce opposition from labor, it has transferred much of its system to Springfield Terminal, a small Guilford subsidiary in Springfield, Vt., which employs members of the United Transportation Union but has flexible work rules and lower wages.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>PARIS -- The recent uproar over a Renault SA plant closing in Belgium may be only the beginning.Thousands more jobs may have to be cut if such industries as autos, telecommunications and banking are to become as efficient in France and Germany as they are in the U.S. and Japan, according to an analysis of Europe's two largest economies.The McKinsey & Co. review suggests that government regulations in France and Germany have slowed economic growth, increased unemployment and have often backfired -- failing to create even the social benefits regulators intended.To an extent, the report states the obvious: High minimum wages, state regulations and stunted capital markets have retarded growth rates on both sides of the Rhine. The report also suggests that in some cases, worse things are yet to come.The auto sector, it says, is suffering because French and German barriers on the number of Japanese cars imported into their domestic markets have delayed necessary restructuring.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The maudlin creepiness of John Edwards's stump speech has been accepted with little complaint by the media. Routinely, he paints America as place where fathers come home, look in their daughter's eyes, and confess what apparently is the greatest insult/failure that can befall a dad: He's lost his job!Mr. Edwards has spent his life as a lawyer, a sector of the economy that never experiences a recession, so perhaps he's unaware that it's quite routine for people to lose jobs. Census data show that job destruction in manufacturing has been remarkably stable over several decades, averaging about 10% a year. The normal toll in the service sector is even higher. That's a lot of devastated fathers and daughters.You can also look at it on the basis of business failures: Of the 9,000 companies big enough to list themselves on a stock exchange, some 200-300 fail every year. Small employers fail at an even higher rate, about 8% a year. In fact, of the million or so small businesses started every year, most will have failed in ten years.Of course, such "normal" job destruction is accompanied by even greater job creation. The ever-churning U.S. labor market manages not just to absorb natural population growth and immigration, but a massive movement of married women into the workforce. This is a healthy economy at work, not a crime against humanity.Mr. Edwards obviously has spent too much time in front of gullible juries. In New York the other day, he bleated that his free-trade critique is a "moral" stance, asserting that children overseas are dragooned to do the jobs being stolen from American fathers. Get it? Just stop trade and all children everywhere will be happy and smiling!</TEXT>

Should the deal be completed, it would give Starwood a clear window into troubled commercial properties around the U.S.A spokesman for the Greenwich, Conn., private equity firm declined to comment.LNR, which was spun off by home builder Lennar Corp. in 1997 and currently is owned by a group that includes Cerberus Capital Management, Vornado Realty Trust and iStar Financial Inc. It has other businesses including debt investment and development. But the bulk of its business comes from special servicing, which has grown as owners have defaulted on tens of billions of dollars in debt since the recession.LNR and other special servicers represent investors who hold bonds backed by pools of loans, known as commercial-mortgage-backed securities.

    <TEXT>The U.S. dollar declined against major foreign currencies yesterday because of lower U.S. interest rates, which make dollar-denominated investments less attractive, and a larger-than-expected decline of 0.9% in U.S. July retail sales.The foreign-exchange market had expected July retail sales to advance by about 0.3%, said Gil Leiendecker Jr., a vice president and manager of the foreign-exchange department of Salomon Brothers Inc., New York. The drop indicated the U.S. economy is slowing faster than expected.Gold rose $4.20 an ounce in response to the decline of the dollar and U.S. interest rates, which make gold purchases easier to finance.Jordan Black, an assistant treasurer of Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said the feeling that U.S. interest rates might continue to ease also hurt the dollar. "But people are hesitant to sell too many dollars," he added, "in the belief that the Federal Reserve may have to tighten credit conditions in the period just after the U.S. election." Any tightening could lead to higher U.S. interest rates.Peter Rogers, an assistant vice president and assistant chief foreign-exchange dealer of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said that "if we don't see a strong rise in the U.S. industrial production number (to be released today), there could be a substantial correction in the dollar."

    <TEXT>New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo says at least three student- loan companies may unfairly charge a uniformly higher rate to students at colleges with populations that are less affluent or include more minorities. Instead, Mr. Cuomo says the companies should base the rates on a family's credit rating.He compared the practice to discriminatory "redlining," when banks and other lending institutions offered less-favorable loan terms to residents of certain areas, such as inner-city neighborhoods. He identified Nelnet Inc., Lincoln, Neb.; Student Loan Xpress Inc., a unit of CIT Group Inc.; and Northstar Education Finance Inc., St. Paul, Minn., as firms that take the institution's information into account when making loans to students, such as the default rate of the school and the earnings history of graduates.Mr. Cuomo's allegations ramp up a new front in his nationwide student-loan-industry investigation, which has exposed widespread payments from lenders to financial-aid officials that he says have compromised the advice offered to students. Congress is cracking down on such practices.Taking institutional factors into account raises disclosure concerns, particularly since entering students aren't informed that "by the way, which college you pick is a factor in what loan you get and what interest rate you pay," Mr. Cuomo said.Lenders say that information can be an important tool when assessing a student's future ability to pay back debt. "When you are making student loans, the collateral is the underlying education," measured by such factors as earning potential of its graduates, says Jamie Wolfe, Northstar's chief financial officer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the time of year when colleges and universities decide on the Class of 2010. It's also when students and parents are in full- throated gripe about the admissions lottery, the opaque system by which high school seniors are accepted or rejected.We don't pretend to understand all of the mysteries of this ultimately arbitrary process. But for all of its imperfections -- witness the former Taliban spokesman who won a coveted slot at Yale, or the recent SAT scoring screwup -- on the whole the college- admissions process does a good job of matching students and schools in what continues to be the best system of higher education in the world. And it even lets us say something good for a change about Harvard -- and Yale too.Cynics will note that the way to get into elite universities is to be a minority, the child of an alum, have a 4.0 GPA and perfect SAT scores, or be a star quarterback or piccolo player. It certainly doesn't hurt to come from a geographically "diverse" place such as Wyoming. And, oh, did we mention that it would help if junior spent last summer scaling Mount Everest or writing a novel?Diversity is a much-maligned word these days -- and for good reason when it is used as justification for racial preferences -- but it is also one of the strengths of U.S. colleges. Unlike virtually everywhere else in the world, applicants to U.S. universities aren't usually selected by a set of fixed academic criteria. Most foreign universities couldn't care less about students' extracurricular activities or whether their parents wore the old school tie.In Japan, entrance exams are everything. All the University of Tokyo cares about is how a kid scores on a test he has spent four years cramming for. European universities show somewhat more flexibility, but if you haven't followed an approved course of study in high school -- to which students are tracked at the age of 10 or 12 -- you can pretty much forget about college.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK--Executives at MetLife Inc. said profits would continue to grow in coming years even if interest rates remain near historic lows, though earnings at its U.S. operations would be roughly flat.The life insurer said Friday that if U.S. Treasury rates remain flat for five years, unemployment levels are unchanged and economic growth doesn't pick up, operating results would be reduced by 21 cents a share next year and 42 cents in 2013.Despite that hit, MetLife Chief Financial Officer Bill Wheeler said the company expects to continue to grow--though at a slower rate. The company said its annual growth rate could be about 4% under that scenario, instead of 8% in a normalized environment."It would have an impact on our financial performance," Mr. Wheeler said. "But it definitely would not weaken the company or put us in a perilous financial position."MetLife's analysis is some of the most explicit so far available to insurance-industry analysts and investors, who have expressed concern about the mounting impact of low rates. Life insurers are sensitive to interest rates because premiums that pour in from policyholders are mostly invested in bonds whose returns help the company meet its obligations. The lower the rates, the lower their investment returns.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So-called safe-harbor flows have meant strong currents for the U.S. Treasurys market throughout the credit-market shakeout.Now it looks like their absence could leave investors flailing. The Federal Reserve's efforts to keep cash moving in the financial system have stopped short of the sort of interest-rate cut the market craves, but they have weighed on Treasurys nevertheless. The question is how much government bonds will suffer from any turnaround in the credit and stock markets.Friday, the Fed cut the borrowing rate on its discount window to 5.75% and extended the term from overnight to 30 days, with the option to renew. The central bank left the key federal-funds rate untouched at 5.25%.It was enough to prompt a significant drop in prices of long-dated Treasurys. The benchmark 10-year note fell 19/32 point, lifting its yield to 4.673%, as debt prices and yields move inversely. At the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.8%.The feeling in the market now is that it isn't so much a question of whether the Fed will cut the fed-funds rate, but when it will do so. According to Credit Suisse, it is a matter of strategy alone; an early cut risks overstepping the mark and forcing an adjustment down the line, with all the attendant volatility and potential damage to the bank's credibility. If credit markets stabilize, the Fed can bide its time and take a more measured approach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The House of Representatives will soon vote on the question of granting the president Trade Promotion Authority, also known as fast-track approval. Some in Congress have argued that now is not the time to take up legislation that has encountered such fierce protectionist opposition in recent years. But in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the current economic slowdown, it is all the more important that Congress move quickly to approve this vital measure.This bipartisan action would inspire confidence in global capital markets. It would allow America to be seen as continuing to lead the open trade and globalization that has been so vital to the prosperity of both developed and developing countries. And it would send a powerful message that the president and Congress speak with one voice, and are committed to advancing freer trade as part of the war on terror. Indeed, approval of TPA would signal that the U.S. is not only seeking a military coalition, but an economic one.The benefits of trade hardly need illuminating. America's exports accounted for approximately one-third of our extraordinary economic growth over the past decade, and exports now support over 12 million American jobs (nearly three million more than a decade ago). Jobs supported by exports typically pay 13% to 18% more than comparable employment.Trade brings real economic benefits to the U.S. The North American Free Trade Agreement, and the completion of the previous round of trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), now generate annual income gains of $1,300 to $2,000 for the average American family of four. Trade is also fundamental to economic growth in the developing world. A recent World Bank study shows that nations open to trade grow 3.5 times faster than nations closed to trade. The recent experience of countries such as South Korea, China and Chile underscore that trade is a pathway to prosperity.Trade is a two-way street, and imports also benefit the U.S. They provide consumers with more choices and lower prices on a wide variety of goods. Imports also force our industries to constantly improve and innovate in order to remain competitive with foreign exporters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MEXICO CITY -- A sharp increase in the number of U.S. visas granted to Mexican nationals will be a foreign-policy priority for incoming President Vicente Fox Quesada, according to a campaign working paper.The policy memorandum, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, says Mexico should consider negotiating a broad new immigration agreement with the U.S. The proposed plan would commit the U.S. to granting Mexicans many more visas in exchange for what would be unprecedented Mexican cooperation in reducing the northward flow of illegal immigrants.A U.S. State Department spokesman said any change in the number of Mexican immigrants allowed into the U.S. would have to be approved by Congress. Nevertheless, he said "we look forward to working with Mr. Fox on the major issues of the relationship, especially immigration and economic issues."A top adviser to Mr. Fox says Mexico also should endorse a recent AFL-CIO initiative to grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants living in the U.S. An estimated eight million Mexicans live in the U.S., with about half believed to have entered without documents. While many are able to legalize their status through marriage or other means, the number of undocumented arrivals is growing faster than ever -- about 300,000 this year.In comparison, the number of Mexicans entering with visas is small, about 70,000 a year, according to the adviser. Despite increased patrolling along the border, migrants keep crossing. Already this year, more than 100 migrants have died attempting to enter the U.S.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How risky are investments in developing countries?There is, of course, no easy answer. Political instability, limited track records, poor statistics -- they all make gauging risk a risky business.But several companies try. What follows is a look at how two outfits evaluate the risk in some of the countries that are receiving the most attention from foreign investors.The two risk-raters:-- Economist Intelligence Unit, a New York-based subsidiary of The Economist Group, London. A rating of A, or 0-20 points, is the least risky. That's followed by B, 25-40 points; C, 45-55 points; D, 60-75 points; and E, 80-100 points. The ratings break down into three categories: medium-term lending risk, covering such factors as external debt and trends in the current account, with a maximum score of 45 points; political and policy risk, including factors such as the consistency of government policy and the quality of economic management, with a maximum score of 40 points; and short-term trade risk, including foreign-exchange reserves, with a cap of 15 points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The recent announcement by New York Life Insurance Co. that it is liquidating its entire $1 billion stock portfolio because of its dissatisfaction with the market's volatility furnishes dramatic evidence that the flight of the investor from the securities market continues unabated. Now, not only the small investor but also some larger institutions are exiting a stock market in which sharp fluctuations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, often unaccompanied by any significant external news or event, recur with predictable frequency.The pattern of these fluctuations is particularly revealing. Often, trading will remain flat throughout the day, only for prices to dive suddenly at the close in the face of heavy institutional trading. Admittedly, one cannot legislate a secure investment environment, but investors are unlikely to return to the market until they see it as a relatively stable repository for their funds. A market that can move 20-30 points in a few minutes, because of sudden selling pressure, will not be so perceived.Yet, wasn't it exactly this problem that the proposals of the Brady Commission and other recent reports were supposed to address? The short answer is no. The recommendations advanced by both Brady and the SEC understandably focused on a worse-case scenario: how to avoid a financial meltdown. As a result, short of a catastrophic event, their proposed reforms will have little impact and could even be counterproductive.Consider, for example, the two most discussed Brady proposals: (1) the circuit-breaker reforms, and (2) the recommendation that margin rules be effectively equalized between the securities and futures exchanges. Will it create confidence among small investors to know that in the future a brief inter-market trading halt will occur once the stock market declines 250 points or more? Such a proposal is as reassuring as a contingency plan for urban survival after a nuclear holocaust.More important, circuit breakers create an incentive to sell as their triggering point is neared; thus, they can exacerbate matters by encouraging a "run on the bank" as investors sell because they suspect others will also do so as the trigger point is neared. If trading halts are to reduce volatility, they will have to be introduced at a much earlier point and seek to bridge temporary order imbalances. Although probably feasible, such a proposal risks the danger that any halt will be interpreted as an adverse signal that triggers still more selling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Corporate America, hurt by the global slowdown, is trying to persuade the Bush administration to abandon the strong-dollar policy that has been a staple of U.S. economic strategy since the mid-1990s.John T. Dillon, International Paper Co.'s chief executive and the new head of the Business Roundtable, pleaded his case at a private meeting with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill yesterday. The dollar's strength against the yen and euro, he said, makes it too hard for U.S. companies to compete with imports and to penetrate foreign markets."There's no question that orders for our products have been off for about a year, and foreign companies are taking an increasing share of the U.S. market," Mr. Dillon said after the meeting with Mr. O'Neill. "It's not that their factories are any more efficient than our factories, but they do have a pretty sizable advantage because of the dollar's relationship with other currencies."During the past two weeks, the dollar has surged to 15-year highs both against the British pound -- down to $1.3981 in late New York trading yesterday from $1.4007 a day earlier -- and against a basket of currencies of major U.S. trading partners. The euro, which sold for 85.45 U.S. cents late yesterday, is 27% weaker against the dollar than when the 12-nation currency made its debut on Jan. 1, 1999.Mr. Dillon said industrial America is in a "deep recession," and that the administration should let the markets know that the U.S. is no longer inclined to prop up the dollar.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Stocks ended more than a week of divergence by falling in unison.High-tech stocks, one of the few sectors to hold up in recent trading, lost ground, as investors took profits in high-priced issues. That halted a streak of seven straight gains by the Nasdaq Composite Index.Blue-chip issues such as Microsoft lost 5 15/16 to 104, while Intel, coming off a 52-week high Tuesday, declined 4 3/16 to 104 5/8 (both on the Nasdaq Stock Market), and Motorola declined 6 13/16 to 153 9/16.Meanwhile, several of the momentum-driven high-tech issues that had persisted in the face of a broad decline in recent sessions got caught in the sell-off. Yahoo! fell 10 13/16 to 362 5/16, while Commerce One eased 9 3/4 to 155 3/8, and Conexant Systems, also coming off a 52-week high, fell 7 to 104 15/16, all on Nasdaq.Some technology issues managed to gain. Juniper Networks rose 16 5/16 to 185 15/16, and Vitesse Semiconductor climbed 5 13/16 to 55 13/16, both on Nasdaq. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq), after an upbeat research note from Bear Stearns, gained 4 9/16 to 91 9/16. Nortel Networks advanced 1 3/4 to 122. Rival Lucent Technologies fell 1 1/8 to 53.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The federal government posted a budget deficit of $44.3 billion in February, wider than the $38.36 billion in red ink a year earlier, the Treasury Department said.But the first five months of fiscal 1996 looked a bit better, with the deficit shrinking to $80.8 billion from $96.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. The Clinton administration, often boasting that its programs have reduced the deficit, has forecast that the fiscal 1996 deficit will total $158 billion, down from $164 billion in the previous year, and that the country will show a surplus in 2002.February's budget gap compared with a surplus of $19.27 billion in January. The government often shows a surplus in December and January, in line with tax payment cycles.In its statement, the Treasury said receipts totaled $89.35 billion last month, compared with $82.54 billion a year earlier and $142.92 billion in January. Outlays totaled $133.64 billion last month, compared with $120.90 billion a year earlier and $123.65 billion in January.---</TEXT>

Shares of MovieFone fluctuated wildly yesterday after the company made a morning announcement that it was in talks for a sale. The stock rose as high as $33 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, then dipped back to close at $26.50 just before trading was halted for AOL's late-afternoon announcement.In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of AOL fell $4.5625 to close at $171.1875.MovieFone, based in New York, is best known for its telephone-ordering service, which lets moviegoers call and buy tickets by punching in a credit-card number. The service -- with its signature introduction, "Hello!

    <TEXT>Just two trading days after the world's seven major industrial countries signaled they wanted to slow the surging dollar and see less-volatile currency markets, traders rebelled.Before retreating on profit-taking, the greenback climbed to 1.6810 marks -- its highest level since May 1994 -- on an unconfirmed report that German policy makers would welcome a stronger dollar.In congressional testimony, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the dollar had "come back into a normal range" and "corrected itself" after earlier misalignments. He also said he believed a strong dollar had contributed to low U.S. inflation and stable growth. Traders said the dollar dipped following his remarks and then rallied when they realized it wasn't headed any lower.Mr. Rubin cautioned yesterday that he wouldn't comment publicly about what he called the behavior of financial markets, but reiterated that the dollar shouldn't be used as a tool in U.S. trade policy.Asked about Japan's economic woes, the Treasury secretary said that the U.S. has concerns about the nation's low growth rates for the past four or five years. But he added that "we aren't concerned about a systemic financial crisis" in Japan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen yesterday but firmed against the West German mark and the British pound in a late-day, short-covering rally that took place in the absence of major central bank intervention.Yesterday was the first trading day since Monday that the Bank of Japan and other major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, didn't intervene to any great extent in the foreign-exchange market. The interventions began after finance ministers from the Big Five industrialized nations -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France -- agreed Sunday on a program aimed at lowering the dollar's value.The West German central bank spent $55.8 million yesterday at the official Frankfurt fixing, which was less than the $82 million spent by the bank the day before as the dollar was weakening substantially. The Bank of France also sold dollars yesterday, for the second successive day, to support the French franc, which has been hurt by the political problems of the French Socialist government. But the sales were described as minimal.The British pound declined 2% against the dollar despite a new Iraqi air attack that crippled Iran's oil terminal on Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf.Ordinarily, anything that might put upward pressure on oil prices would help the pound, as Britain derives a large share of its foreign-exchange earnings from its own North Sea oil production.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Investors who arrived late at the small-stock party take heart: You can still get in on the merrymaking, if history serves as a guide.Even latecomers fared well in three out of the four small-stock rallies since the Great Depression that most closely resemble the current surge in small stocks.Like the current rally, those four began as the economy was crawling out of recessions. They gained steam as the economy strengthened. Only one of the four died. But the loser was the most recent rally, which followed the early 1980s recession.Small stocks soared a remarkable 46% last year, as measured by the Russell 2000 index. Now many investors wonder whether they can still profit handsomely if they missed the powerful first stage of a small-stock rally.It is a question "that I was asked at least 15 times last week," says Jim Collins, small-stock money manager and publisher of OTC Insight of Moraga, Calif. He is advising clients to invest after the powerful Christmas rally cools a bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HONG KONG--The U.S. unemployment rate should fall below 6% by the end of 2014, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Wednesday at an investor conference in Hong Kong.Mr. Bullard, a member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said the U.S. economy is improving and unemployment had fallen much more quickly than many people expected.The Fed had previously committed to keeping short-term rates low well past the time when the unemployment rate fell below 6.5%, especially if inflation remained below 2%. The unemployment rate stood at 6.7% in February, while inflation has failed to rise significantly and economic growth remains fragile.That pushed the Fed at its policy meeting last week to drop reference in its regular statement to the unemployment threshold. Instead, the statement said rates will stay low for a considerable time after the Fed's bond-buying program ends.Mr. Bullard, speaking at a conference organized by Credit Suisse, said the FOMC from now on would use "more standard" and "qualitative" language rather than relying on quantitative thresholds to guide market expectations of future rate decisions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When stocks collapsed in a free fall last May, the fear was that the market had been taken over by high-speed computers that had run amok.A year after the "flash crash," which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge 600 points in less than 10 minutes, the stock market is a much quieter place.Companies that use fast-trading, computer-driven strategies, which were painted by some as culprits of the collapse, have curtailed trading. So, too, have many long-term investors, for whom the trauma of that May 6 afternoon was the final straw after a decade of stock-market turmoil. In their absence, trading volume and volatility have plunged, further deterring high-frequency traders.High-frequency strategies "have less to work with, so they don't participate, which creates less volume," said Will Mechem, a managing partner at high-frequency trading firm Pan Alpha Trading. "This would seem to be a vicious cycle."In the first four months of this year, average daily trading volume of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market is down 15% from 2010's pace, running at an average rate of 6.3 billion shares a day. Volume has been edging lower throughout the year, with April's daily average of 5.8 billion shares marking the slowest month since May 2008.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The euro eked out an advance against the dollar as investors turned modestly optimistic about the pace of the global economic recovery, despite lingering concerns over the euro-zone debt crisis.Unconfirmed reports of strong Chinese export figures boosted currencies closely tied to global economic growth, while Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's cautiously optimistic tone on the U.S. economy also supported the rally.But a late-afternoon slip in U.S. stocks threw cold water on the run-up in riskier currencies, and investors likely pared their euro holdings ahead of Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank, said Ron Leven, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. The central bank isn't expected to increase its target rates. Still, investors will listen closely for details on how the bank is dealing with issues related to euro-zone sovereign debt.As investors took risk off the table in late afternoon, the dollar hit an intraday low against the yen. The Japanese currency tends to strengthen when investors unwind bets on higher-yielding currencies.By late afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.1987, compared with $1.1947 late Tuesday in New York. The dollar was at 91.17 yen from 91.39 yen. The euro was at 109.28 yen from 109.18 yen. The U.K. pound strengthened to $1.4533 from $1.4426.

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- A weaker dollar and heavy selling by some foreign investors depressed long-term bonds, while short-term securities rose amid continued speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease credit policies.The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 5/8 point, or about $6.25 per $1,000 face amount. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 8.13% from 8.06% Monday. Meanwhile, bond-equivalent yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.02% from an average of 8.24% at the government's auction on Monday.As a result, the 30-year bonds now yield more than three-month Treasury bills for the first time since May 23. This relationship, in which short-term rates drop below long-term rates, is known as a "positive yield curve" and is often viewed as a sign that investors are expecting stable or possibly higher long-term interest rates down the road.If the positive yield curve remains that way, it could also signal that the powerful bond market rally "may be close to its end," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.The yield curve had been "inverted" for most of the past three months. That's an unusual configuration where long-term bond yields stand below the yields on short-term Treasury bills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jittery investors pinned their hopes on consumer and insurance stocks last quarter -- a stock market trend that some experts say may continue for a while.During the third quarter, the overall market declined slightly, as shown by the 1.4% fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But that masks a distinct switch in investors' preferences. An analysis of the Dow Jones Industry Groups shows that food, retail and other consumer stocks averaged gains of 5% to 13% for the quarter. Meanwhile, technology stocks took a pounding throughout the quarter, reversing their gains of earlier this year."If people are looking for a way to put money back in the stock market without blowing off their hand, these stocks {large-capitalization consumer issues} are the way to do it," says Michael Sherman, a portfolio strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Such stocks are expected to hold up relatively well in a recession, he observes.As a case in point, Scott McKay, a vice president at HT Investors Inc., says his Providence, R.I., money-management concern is emphasizing consumer stocks "as a defensive move." Recent economic signals have been confusing, he says. But he figures that if equity prices slump, consumer stocks and some depressed financial issues "won't go down as much as the rest of the market."Of the 10 best performing industry groups last quarter, four were in consumer sectors. Tobacco stocks did best, up 13.5%, though they appear only as part of the household products group. Of the formal industry categories, pollution control led the pack, up 12.9%, followed by food retailers, up 12.8%. Meanwhile, all of the 10 biggest laggards were in technology or industrial areas. That includes the weakest performer, semiconductor stocks, down 27.1%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of Americans buy life insurance and a lot hold stocks. But only a small number own a product combining the two, called variable universal life insurance, or VUL.It's a product that has long been out of favor with many financial advisers. But these days it's a better choice for some families than other combinations of insurance and savings, says James Hunt, longtime insurance specialist for the Consumer Federation of America.Variable universal life is a type of permanent insurance--designed to remain in place no matter how long the policyholder lives, unlike term life. Permanent life insurance combines a death benefit with a tax-deferred savings component that becomes tax-free at the death of the holder.Variable universal life, unlike other permanent life insurance, allows the holder to select from a menu of stock and bond funds.For years, VUL got a thumbs-down from many financial advisers and insurance specialists, largely because these policies typically come with steep insurance charges and high investment fees. Mr. Hunt has been one of the critics of those high costs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HOUSTON--Chesapeake Energy Corp. Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon said Monday that a $3 billion unsecured loan from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Jefferies Group Inc. would enable the gas driller to complete the asset sales it needs for survival from "a position of strength."He also said the company is delaying a $1 billion deal tied to the Eagle Ford oil shale in Texas but that other major asset sales are on track.The new loan, which the embattled company disclosed late Friday, would help Chesapeake repay borrowings from a revolving credit line that could be tightened by the effect of low natural-gas prices on the company's reserves. That tightening, which the company described as a risk in a filing Friday, could restrict sales of energy assets, which lenders could require to be pledged as increased collateral amid lower gas prices. The new loan would be repaid with the proceeds of asset sales that Chesapeake plans to execute in the third quarter--deals that Mr. McClendon said are on track.Low natural-gas prices have forced Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake, the second-largest producer of the commodity in the U.S., into a major transition. The company now seeks to focus on more profitable oil instead, but to do so it must engage in massive spending--on top of the large debt it has already accumulated increasing its natural-gas reserves. To raise the money, Chesapeake is engaging in different types of deals, including selling down stakes in positions it has aggressively built during the last decade.He said the company chose to take the loan from Goldman and Jefferies to assure investors that it is well positioned to evolve from being primarily a natural-gas producer to one more focused on oil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Suppose your federal government dramatically slashed tax rates for the well-to-do, all in the name of promoting economic growth. Suppose, too, that it is running a budget deficit and plans to do so for at least the next several years.You might assume that you live in a country governed by a bunch of reckless right-wingers, willing to risk the nation's economic health for the benefit of a tiny fat-cat constituency. In fact, you reside in socialist Western Europe.Though most of Europe's countries are ruled by left-of-center governments, taxes are coming down across the Continent. Not only are tax-loving countries like the Netherlands and Sweden cutting rates, but so are economic heavyweights like France (yes, France) and Germany.Meanwhile, the only major industrial country that is running a large budget surplus, but where apparently respectable people still claim that it can't afford a major tax cut, is the U.S. Viewed from a European perspective, America's epic tax debate is strange indeed.Of course, Europe's tax cuts aren't nearly as big as they might be, and opposition parties have vowed to push through bigger relief if they regain power. Yet measured by the standards of American liberals, countries like Germany are about to enjoy "irresponsible" tax relief. Indeed, the tax cut that Berlin started to phase in at the beginning of this year is bigger than President George W. Bush's controversial $1.6 trillion plan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Conference Board's composite index of leading indicators slipped in September for the fourth straight month, signaling that the economic soft patch will persist.Separately, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped by an unexpectedly steep 25,000 last week, a decline that may have been skewed by the holiday-shortened week.The Conference Board, a private research group in New York, reported that its composite index of leading indicators fell by 0.1% to a reading of 115.6 in September, after August's 0.3% decline. The slightness of the declines in the past four months seems to argue against invoking the economists' rule of thumb that three consecutive declines in the index signal a recession."While the leading index is not yet signaling a downturn, the growth rate of the leading index has slowed," said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board. Economic growth should continue, but more slowly than expected, he added. The index is designed to predict the economy's path during the next three to six months.Oil prices have had a negative impact on the economy, but not enough to produce a broad spike in inflation. Recent hurricanes may also have held down economic activity, the Conference Board said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The once-dizzying rise in the value of privately owned Facebook Inc. has slowed, a sign the social network hasn't been immune to broader market volatility or the weakness in the global economy.Despite the cooling, Facebook next year still is expected to make one of the largest U.S. initial public offerings ever. For now, its stock is traded on secondary marketplaces where wealthy investors and institutions can purchase shares offered mostly by former employees.Facebook share prices surged 70% to $34 in March from December, as reported in auctions by SharesPost Inc., a trading platform for stocks of privately owned companies. The growth since has leveled off, with shares trading at $35 or below. Facebook's price has fallen 8% since July, to $32.10 in a SharesPost auction held last week, valuing the entire company at roughly $77 billion.Facebook isn't alone, or even the worst hit of its bretheren. Hot technology companies that have gone public in recent years also took hits in the market-wide downturn. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has dropped 16% from its April peak, during which time the Nasdaq Stock Market Internet index has slid 21%.Investors and analysts say the price of Facebook's stock, owned mostly by employees and outside investors, can't easily be pinned down because trades take place in a variety of venues, some of which don't disclose the prices. Also, valuations based on just a few buyers and sellers might not reflect how a company would be valued if millions of its shares were traded publicly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Stocks rallied in an old-fashioned reaction to declining interest rates and strong earnings reports.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.95, or 1%, to 2905.45. At its peak, the industrial average was up about 50 points. New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 196,570,000 shares, the strongest in a week. Advancing issues swamped decliners, 1,108 to 508.Short-term interest rates tumbled yesterday as investors began to anticipate another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve Board. They were encouraged by Thursday's weak inflation and retail sales reports. The producer price index for March slipped 0.3%, while the core of the index, minus food and energy prices, added only 0.2%. Retail sales in March fell 0.8%.Many analysts believe the data give the Fed an opportunity to lower rates while maintaining its anti-inflationary stance. Some expect the Fed to act today if the slowing producer inflation numbers are confirmed by evidence of moderating consumer price increases. The consumer price index will be released at 8:30 a.m. EDT."It is amazing how the mentality on the Street is changing so rapidly," asserted Richard Meyer, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.

    <TEXT>The dollar was modestly stronger against the euro Wednesday, first on general risk aversion following a raft of disappointing data and then on cautiousness ahead of the European Central Bank meeting.Discouraging data overnight helped to erode market confidence, setting a risk-averse tone that typically favors the dollar. When a glimmer of improvement in a U.S. manufacturing report helped to lift U.S. stocks, though, the euro remained down with traders unwilling to take new bets ahead of a euro-zone monetary-policy meeting Thursday.Analysts widely expect a half-percentage-point cut to the ECB's key rate to 1%, while some predict new nontraditional easing measures. "The risks are that the ECB is going to move more slowly than the market is expecting, and that will be euro-constructive," said Ron Leven, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York.Meanwhile, the dollar weakened against the yen, one day after sharp gains associated with the close of the fiscal year in Japan. Mr. Leven said the reversal of that move Wednesday may indicate a seasonal trend as investors re-enter the market.Wednesday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.3232 from $1.3286 late Tuesday, and the dollar was at 98.67 yen from 98.95 yen. The euro was at 130.56 yen from 131.47. The U.K. pound was at $1.4438 from $1.4383, while the dollar was at 1.1460 Swiss francs from 1.1383 francs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Joliet, Ill. -- In this blue-collar city, both political parties will spend the fall vying for the attention and affection of citizens like Carol Rapcan.They will have to take a number and stand in line.Even as the presidential sex scandal fills the front pages, Ms. Rapcan says lots of things are more important to her life than national politics. At age 55, she devotes much energy to her three daughters. She is also focused on the good economy. A busy bridal-shop owner is practically begging her to come and do alterations. At her regular job -- working the gift shop at Harrah's casino in town -- Ms. Rapcan watches as more and more people line up to spend their extra cash.And in the past couple of years, something else has grabbed her by the heart: "Religion and the Lord," Ms. Rapcan says, clasping her hands together. Twice a week, she drives more than an hour to church. Last week, the sermon was on forgiveness. The week before, it was about seeing the good in everyone. Ms. Rapcan says she gets a lot more out of those messages than out of anything politicians can do for her.Apparently, she is one of many who place politics far down on the list of things that influence their lives. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, the bulk, or 48% of people surveyed, say developments in medicine and health care affect their lives a "great deal."

    <TEXT>Investors were quick to scoop up the latest new issue of global depositary shares from Samsung Electronics Co. No wonder: The South Korean chip maker is being billed as the cheapest semiconductor stock in the world.Even those fund managers who prefer to be underweighted in South Korea right now admit they're fans of Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest producer of memory chips."Bottom up, we like Samsung Electronics," says Eric Sandlund, managing director of Prudential Portfolio Managers in Hong Kong. He says Prudential subscribed to the recent GDS offering even though he's keeping an underweighted position in the South Korean stock market overall."We like the company and it's trading at under six times [prospective 1995] earnings. Even if you take the view that the [semiconductor] industry is near the top of the cycle . . . it looks cheap," Mr. Sandlund says.Indeed Samsung Electronics' low price/earnings ratio has analysts and investors swarming over the stock. "Why pay [13 to 14] times prospective earnings for a U.S. semiconductor stock when you can buy a similar company on the other side of the world, with potentially better earnings predictability and superior economies of scale, at only one-third of the price?" asks Namuh Rhee, vice president at J.P. Morgan Securities in Hong Kong, in a recent report on the company.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- New construction contracts awarded in May fell 6% from April, reflecting a sharp rise in interest rates, F.W. Dodge Co. said.Nonresidential building, consisting of commmercial, industrial and institutional construction, dropped 8% while residential building declined 7%. Public works construction rose slightly.F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said U.S. construction contracts awarded in May dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $233.5 billion from a $247.6 billion rate in April. That brought the Dodge index to 149, down from 158 the previous month. The index compares current contracting with a 1982 base of 100."When interest rates go up, construction activity comes down -- it's one of the axioms of this business," said George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W. Dodge. "But if the surge of mortgage rates proves to be short-lived, as we expect, it means that a lot of this year's lost potential -- mainly one-family housing -- should be recovered in 1988 as rates retreat again."Highway construction gave the industry its only boost in May as contracts for so-called nonbuilding construction, which includes public works and utilities, rose 3% to $46.4 billion. Mr. Christie said strength in that area in May continued to make up for transportation projects that were delayed earlier this year when federal funding was interrupted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The summer's sobering trade numbers give new credence to the view that the nation's disturbing trade gap isn't likely to narrow significantly until there's a recession.That's not to say a recession is desirable. The heavy debt burdens of U.S. companies and Third World nations, as well as the continued weakness of the banking system, raise fears that a recession now would quickly snowball into financial disaster.Nor does a recession appear imminent. At the moment, most indicators point to an economy that is picking up, not sputtering out.But the stubborn intransigence of the trade figures, despite Treasury Secretary James Baker's policy to devalue the dollar, suggests no other medicine may be strong enough. The monthly merchandise trade gap set new records in June and July, hitting $15.7 billion and then $16.5 billion. That rise partly reflects seasonal distortions in the statistics; but at best, the trade trend is flat."I've been looking for improvement and haven't seen it, and I'm beginning to get discouraged," says Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Charles Kindleberger. "This may mean we have to have a recession" before the deficit numbers are reversed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Builder Toll Brothers Inc. swung to a bigger-than-expected profit in the fiscal second quarter, boosted by increased sales and fewer cancellations.The results continue a strong selling season that is leading many industry watchers to declare that the hard-hit market has finally struck bottom. Builders nationwide are reporting increased sales and orders from a year ago, and existing-home sales are also up.Sales of new homes climbed 3.3% in April from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 343,000, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. Sales were up 9.9% from a year ago. Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported that existing-home sales climbed 3.4% from March, and prices increased about 10% from the prior year to $177,400, the strongest year-over-year gain since January of 2006.Toll, which caters largely to affluent move-up buyers in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, is seeing improvement along Florida's east coast and around Phoenix, markets that were hit hard by the housing-market crash."The housing market has moved into a new and stronger phase of recovery as we have experienced broad-based improvement across most of our regions over the past six months," said Chief Executive Douglas C.

    <TEXT>Arnold Schwarzenegger is following the wrong script. After taking over as governor in 2003, he was expected to vanquish business-as- usual politicians in Sacramento -- and pull California from the brink of fiscal ruin. Instead, he has decided to put his own political future ahead of the economic survival of his beloved Golden State. How else to interpret his recent move to join ranks with his opponents in Sacramento to put a pork-heavy $37 billion bond infrastructure proposal on the November ballot?Mr. Schwarzenegger's move officially marks the end of his grand plans to reform Sacramento, earning him kudos from many California Democrats. Sen. Don Perata, the most influential Democrat in the state legislature, and Senate Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez have praised Mr. Schwarzenegger's leadership and pledged to campaign with him this fall to promote the initiative. Making joint appearances with prominent Democrats while he is campaigning for re-election will help cement Mr. Schwarzenegger's image as a political moderate, something he has been trying hard to cultivate in this bluest of blue states since last year. That's when the state's public unions accused him of right-wing partisanship, and defeated the bold reform initiatives he put on the ballot to curtail their influence on state government and politics.The real issue, however, is what this bond measure will do to California. Few doubt the need for California to invest in its crumbling infrastructure. But this is an infrastructure bond in name only. The four big-ticket items in the bond -- which is two times bigger than the biggest bond in the state's history -- are $2.6 billion for housing, $10.4 billion for K-12 schools and universities, $3.1 billion for levee repairs and $19.2 billion for transportation.The housing bond is simply welfare masquerading as a capital project. A bulk of its money won't fund general infrastructure -- an acceptable use of general-obligation bonds like these -- but such things as cheap multifamily dwellings for low-income families, and down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers.The education bond is equally misguided, given that 40% of the state's $94 billion general-fund revenues are already constitutionally earmarked for education. Moreover, California voters approved a total of $25 billion for school-construction bonds in 2002 and 2004 to reduce overcrowding. If there is still not enough money for new schools, it is not because of lack of state spending, but abject waste by individual districts. If anything, this handout will encourage more waste by undercutting districts' need to explore the kind of public- private partnership responsible for Inderkum High School in Sacramento being completed a month early and $2.5 million under budget. In this case, a private developer built the school and district authorities used their public dollars to lease the facility from him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Corporate restructuring left many American companies leaner in their operations but more heavily in debt. And now, a wave of stock buy-backs, corporate takeovers and sales of companies to their managements is pushing them even further -- perhaps dangerously -- into hock.Already, the corporate debt in default is climbing rapidly. The 1981-82 recession raised it, just as you would expect: Annual corporate defaults climbed to more than $840 million from $60 million. But now, despite an economic rebound for more than five years, defaults have, perversely, soared. Last year alone, they reached a towering sum of nearly $9 billion.To many analysts' surprise, even the Oct. 19 stock-market crash hasn't discouraged companies from increasing their borrowings. Right after the crash, many companies, despite fears of an impending recession, launched extensive programs to borrow funds and buy back their shares to try to shore up stock prices.And in recent months, the merger-and-acquisition mania has broken out again; on Feb. 29 alone, more than $12 billion of takeover plans, mostly involving debt, were announced. Companies may be rushing to buy while the Reagan administration still keeps the antitrust watchdogs on a short leash.The borrowing binge has many economists worrying about what may happen in the next recession, which most analysts surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter, expect next year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- With inflation fears on the rise, investors may want to make sure their target-date funds' inflation-fighting strategies match their own.Managers of these funds, typically funds of funds that are a popular tool for retirement planning, adopt varying strategies for protecting investors from inflation and differ on just how much protection is required."A lot of these firms are still sort of struggling with how to do it," says Josh Charlson, a senior mutual-fund analyst at Morningstar Inc. More are "adding some slice of TIPS," he says, referring to Treasury inflation-protected securities, a government bond designed to provide a return indexed to inflation.Target-date funds automatically move toward more-conservative investments as an investor ages, known as the glide path. Some use inflation-fighting components only in longer-dated funds.Since long-term inflation risk is low for younger investors, many longer-dated target-date funds hold significant stock positions and diversify globally, Mr. Charlson said. Inflation becomes more of a concern for investors nearing retirement, so short-dated funds often add TIPS -- usually not more than 10% of assets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The crosscurrents roiling the bond market intensified Thursday, as the gap between short- and long-term U.S. Treasury yields narrowed in the latest sign of uncertainty over the pace of U.S. growth.Yields on short-term U.S. Treasury debt maturing in two to five years hit the highest level since 2011, reflecting an investor scramble to place bets on an expected Federal Reserve rate increase as soon as next spring. Yields rise when prices fall.The selloff in short-term government debt extended a pullback that began following Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision to end its bond purchases later this year.At the same time, yields on government debt maturing in 10 or more years have risen only modestly this week and remain well below their levels at the start of 2014, a year that many analysts forecast would include rising long-term interest rates and falling bond prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 8/32 lower, yielding 2.629%. That is the highest closing level since July 3 but compares with 3% at the end of 2013.The softness of longer-term yields highlights concerns shared by many analysts and policy makers about the uneven growth of the U.S. economy and falling expectations for inflation. Investors broadly expect the Fed to raise the fed funds rate next year for the first time since 2006. But many analysts say that even a small uptick in rates could slow the economy and send already-low inflation further below the Fed's target.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- As much as everyone would like to see an endless economic expansion, there are some unmistakable signs that the business cycle may finally be entering its downward phase.No, Asia's currency troubles of recent months are not one of them. Most economists figure the cause and effects of the turmoil in the currency markets may have a modest negative impact on the U.S. economy but won't derail the expansion -- now six and a half years old and the third longest on record.More troublesome, they say, is that for the first time since the end of the last recession in early 1991, businesses are borrowing faster than consumers. The longer this trend persists, economists believe, the greater the chances for a supply/demand imbalance that leaves too many goods and services for too few buyers."The risk to the economy now is overproduction," of everything from bagels to athletic shoes to sports utility vehicles, says Merrill Lynch & Co. chief investment strategist Charles Clough. He is concerned that the unusually high debt burden consumers are carrying has finally prompted them to rein in spending. And the combination of weak sales and strong factory output spells trouble for the economy, he said.And the potential for a glut could increase, says Mr. Clough, if countries in Southeast Asia decide to solve their financial and economic woes by speeding up production and dumping their output in the U.S.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Investors seeking income growth with less risk than that posed by the broad stock market have long bought shares of companies that regularly boost dividends.But amid the financial crisis of the past year, the strategy -- and, along with it, dividend-focused mutual funds -- took a big hit as banks and other once-reliable sources of dividends slashed payouts to conserve cash. The shares of these companies also plummeted, making it one of the worst periods in memory for dividend-oriented funds.Many such funds posted returns of minus 25% or worse for 2008. Although that wasn't quite as bad as last year's almost 40% drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the poor performance of such funds stunned shareholders who thought they had chosen a fairly conservative investment approach.Many of those investors are now looking for income and greater principal stability in places such as the bond market, while some advisers are steering clients toward different stock strategies.But if you are thinking about throwing in the towel on dividends and dividend-focused funds, there may be reasons to reconsider.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These days, economists have plenty to worry about. Add what's happening in Leesburg, Va., to the list.In that Washington, D.C., suburb, real-estate agent Ray Mauk has been trying to sell a four-bedroom, two-story house for the past two months. He figured it would sell "in a day or two," given the recent frenzy for homes in the area. But instead, he has been forced to reduce the $395,000 asking price three times -- lowering it by $5,000 on each occasion. "The market," says Mr. Mauk, just "isn't there."Despite a slowing economy, the U.S. housing market has held strong and is widely credited with having helped to stave off a recession. But in a handful of cities across the country, cracks are starting to appear in the housing market's once-solid foundation.From San Francisco to Minneapolis to Denver, some real-estate agents say demand is slowing and the number of available homes is increasing -- often a sign of weakness. Meanwhile, home builder Centex Homes, a unit of Centex Corp. in Dallas, is offering a $10,000 discount or free amenities on some new homes in the Atlanta area to stimulate demand. And in Dallas, where inventories are up 24% from last year, price reductions are becoming more common.Although home sales overall remain healthy by historical standards, discounting and rising inventories "are the indications that usually start off telling me we're going to see a [tougher] market," says Petey Parker, vice president of Ebby Halliday Realtors in Dallas. "It's a different market" than it was a few months ago, adds Marsha Sell, a sales associate at Coldwell Banker Buckhead Brokers in Atlanta.

    <TEXT>Yesterday Wall Street and the government's top financial regulators were in a place they'd rather not be: Wrapped in a bear hug from Congress. Whatever the merits of the case for the Federal Reserve's decision to let J.P. Morgan buy Bear Stearns, the deal raised sufficient and legitimate questions of public interest to justify Senator Chris Dodd and his Senate Banking Committee brethren getting up close and personal with Ben Bernanke and the rest of the boys who did the deal. No one should expect Congress to regard this as a once- only date.Details that emerged from the hearing offered a better understanding of the high drama during the days of the sale. These particulars make us inclined to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt on doing the basic deal to forestall systemic risk. We remain unconvinced about the new precedent of the government holding $29 billion in mortgage- related securities as collateral.As described, the Fed learned from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday evening March 13 that Bear would have to declare bankruptcy the next morning. That Thursday, according to SEC Chairman Chris Cox, Bear's liquidity dropped to $2 billion from $12 billion. That would focus anyone's mind. Bear's customers and counterparties were accelerating their refusal to deal with the bank. As Mr. Cox summarized: "Run" isn't normally associated with investment banks, but "the analogy is nearly complete."At the most basic level of justification -- that Bear's collapse posed a systemic risk to both the financial market and the broader economy -- the regulators made a plausible case for their actions that weekend. But once past this first-order goal, we find much in the testimony to merit concern.Exhibit A remains that mammoth guarantee by the Fed to finance billions in illiquid Bear assets. The best face we can put on this decision, based on what was said yesterday, is that the regulators considered the $30 billion to be chump change against the larger, immediate threat to the system. Then as a gesture of mitigation, J.P. Morgan took on the first billion of potential losses from the assets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The housing market is in recovery mode, but one type of mortgage investment has gotten hammered lately. Experts say investors should wait awhile longer before wading back in.Mortgage real-estate investment trusts are companies that buy mortgage-backed securities and pay most of the returns to investors as dividends. The group plunged 5.9% in the five days through Oct. 15, the largest such drop since October 2011.The selloff might have some investors considering picking up the REITs on the cheap. In 2010 and 2011, similar drops have presented opportunities for people with the patience--and nerves--to jump back in. This time, however, investors should resist the urge, experts say.Past selloffs were driven mainly by fears about the sustainability of the financial system. The current plunge has more to do with concerns about the sustainability of the sector's dividends, spurred by the Federal Reserve's decision to start buying mortgage-backed securities, and experts say the worries are unlikely to be assuaged soon."There's more room to go," says Andy Kapyrin, director of research at RegentAtlantic Capital in Morristown, N.J.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- A lack of conviction kept a lot of traders sitting on the sidelines of the options market.With few reasons to take a stand on the direction of the broad market, or even individual stocks, traders wiled away the session reviewing earnings reports and watching the stock market swing like a pendulum between positive and negative territory.Options on some individual stocks traded strongly on specific news or strong hunches.Microsoft Corp.'s announcement of a 2-for-1 stock split, subject to shareholder approval, made it the most actively traded option at all four exchanges.International Business Machines Corp., whose board meets today, also may announce a stock split, analysts said. IBM was the second most actively traded option in the market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The stock market's fear gauge has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, as investors drop their bets on large stock swings.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, hit a 14-month low on Thursday of 11.68 before closing at 12.03.The index, an options-based measure of traders' expectations for price swings in the S&P 500, is widely viewed as a proxy for the stock market's capacity for sudden spikes and plunges.Many traders say they detect little fear in the market lately. They cite a financial outlook that is widely perceived to pose little risk of an economic or market downturn: near-record stock prices, low interest rates, steady if unspectacular U.S. growth and expansive if receding Federal Reserve support for the economy and financial markets.The VIX's three-month average this week hit 14.1, a level, before 2013's stock rally, last consistently seen in 2007. In the past 10 years, the VIX has averaged 20.08, including a 2008 financial-crisis spike above 80 and a 2011 euro-crisis jump to 48.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>THE CURRENT STATE of the bed-and-breakfast business belies the belief that bigger is better.When sized up against their larger brethren in the lodging industry, bed-and-breakfast inns, which typically have 25 rooms or fewer, appear to have fared better since the recession hit the U.S. economy last spring. And they bounced back quicker from the vacancies brought on by the events of Sept. 11."To a certain extent, bed and breakfasts are shielded from recessionary effects," says Robert Mandelbaum, research director at PKF Consulting, a hospitality advisory firm, who helps the Professional Association of Innkeepers International compile data from its biennial industry survey. Guests of bed-and-breakfast inns tend to be affluent leisure travelers who are less likely to be susceptible to change during a recession, he says.Average occupancy or room-rate data for the bed-and-breakfast sector is difficult to come by. Jerry Phillips, executive director of the Professional Association of Innkeepers, estimates there are about 18,000 bed-and-breakfast and country inns in the U.S., with about 36% in the Northeast, 28% in the West, 20% in the South and 15% in the Midwest.Many inns, particularly those within driving distance of New York City, fared well after the attacks as people canceled their vacations and opted instead for getaways that didn't involve hopping on an airplane, says Bill Oates, a consultant in Brattleboro, Vt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Osama bin Laden said that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks "struck deep at the heart of America's economy." He was wrong. The U.S. economy was scraped and bruised on that terrible day, but it is clear that the heart of the American economy is still beating strongly.Despite an estimated $120 billion of damage and a great deal of anxiety, one year after the attacks an economic recovery is underway. In fact, the three-quarter recession that began in early 2001 ended within 45 days of 9/11, and real GDP has now expanded for three consecutive quarters.By early October 2001, consumers and businesses were back up and running. After seeing weak sales in mid-September, automobile manufacturers instituted 0% financing and auto sales soared in October to an annualized rate of 21.3 million units, a record high.Other retailers experienced similar results. Excluding autos, retail sales fell 1.2% in September, but rebounded by the same 1.2% in October. To complete the pattern, durable goods new orders fell 6.8% in September, only to rebound 9.2% in October.Real GDP fell by less (-0.3%) in the third quarter of 2001, which included the impact of the attacks, than it did in the second quarter (-1.6%), just before the attacks. While the airline and hotel industries are still experiencing a depressed level of activity, other spending has not only recovered, but more than offset travel-related losses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The CostOf Inflation?Growth, It SeemsThe good news today is that inflation isn't heating up much. The bad news is it hasn't cooled down much, either.Today's report on consumer inflation from the Labor Department should show prices picked up last month, but only temporarily. Economists estimate the consumer-price index rose 0.6% in May from April's level, largely due to a run-up in gasoline prices that have since subsided. Economists look for the "core" index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, to rise 0.2%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Following her broker's advice, Cecilia Walsh put her entire $375,000 divorce settlement into auction-rate securities last December, planning on using the money for her day-to-day needs.Yet before she ever withdrew a penny from the account, the auction- rate-debt market froze up, and Ms. Walsh, a 47-year-old actor in Delray Beach, Fla., was unable to withdraw any of her money. Her broker, UBS AG, gave her a margin loan secured by her account so that Ms. Walsh could pay her living expenses. But UBS later marked down the value of the securities in her account and has demanded that she repay part of the loan.In the four months since auction-rate securities stopped trading normally, investors like Ms. Walsh have been taking out loans, selling their securities at big discounts, filing arbitration cases against their brokers, or simply waiting and hoping that the market will start functioning again. The one thing they haven't found is an easy way to get their money back.For decades, individuals and companies bought auction-rate debt from municipalities, charitable organizations, student lenders and closed- end mutual funds. The securities had long-term maturities but functioned like a short-term investment, paying interest rates that were reset in weekly or monthly auctions conducted by Wall Street firms. Brokerage firms and financial advisers pitched them to investors as a safe place to stash one's cash and collect a higher yield than a money-market fund offered, often tax-free.As a result, the $330 billion auction-rate securities market attracted many investors who were risk-averse or, like Ms. Walsh, knew they would need the money in the near future. But beginning in February, as the subprime-lending crisis spread to affect nearly all areas of the credit markets, auctions failed to attract sufficient bidders. Wall Street firms stopped supporting the market, causing it to freeze up and blindsiding thousands of small investors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>THE FEDERAL RESERVE pushed up short-term interest rates by one-half percentage point, sending a clear inflation-fighting message. The increase is likely to raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses: Many big banks raised their prime lending rates after the Fed announcement. The rise also is likely to bolster the dollar against foreign currencies.The credit tightening sparked a rally in bond prices, pulling stocks higher. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond soared nearly 1 3/4 points as its yield fell to 7.36%. The Dow Jones industrials rose 24.28 to 3784.57.---American Home Products and American Cyanamid renewed takeover talks yesterday, even as American Home's unusual one-day offer expired.

    <TEXT>For years, an obscure class of Wall Street investment vehicles has acted like a locomotive in the housing-finance business, driving growth by soaking up risky mortgage bonds and parceling them out to investors around the world.Now, as mortgage problems mount and a wave of mortgage-bond downgrades looms, these investments, known as collateralized debt obligations, are starting to look like a different vehicle -- rockets overloaded with combustible fuel.Some big investment banks have been wavering when launching new CDO deals because of problems in the subprime mortgage market, which caters to the least credit-worthy borrowers. The problems also have investors demanding much higher returns on the CDOs they buy, which makes them harder to sell and drives down their prices.CDOs are an integral part of Wall Street's mortgage dicing-and- slicing machine. After mortgages are written, investment banks pool them together and use the cash flows they produce to pay off mortgage- backed bonds, which the investment banks underwrite.The mortgage bonds, in turn, are often packaged again into CDOs and sold off in slices. Investors can choose to buy the risky pieces of the bonds or purchase slices with less risk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>THE DOW JONES Industrial Average bypassed its high within minutes of the market open, then again near the close, but trimmed its gains to finish shy of the record.The indicator, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies, posted an intraday high of 11728.46, up 5.48 points from its January 2000 peak. But on the day, the Dow industrials finished up 29.21 points, or 0.29%, at 11718.45, up 9.3% on the year.Among the Dow average's strongest components were Caterpillar and General Motors. GM rose after Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda, which owns 9.9% of GM's shares outstanding, said it was considering purchasing as many as 12 million more shares of the auto maker. Tracinda also said it supports an alliance between GM and Renault-Nissan.However, the three names with the biggest influence weightings in the price-weighted Dow industrial average -- International Business Machines, Altria Group and Boeing -- all finished the day off less than 0.5%. Even modest gains at one or two of those companies would have sent the Dow industrial average over its record, which now stands just 4.53 points away, at 11722.98."The Dow is teasing everybody right now," said Kenneth Tower, chief market strategist at the online-brokerage firm CyberTrader.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The New York Stock Exchange struck an agreement with the city and state of New York to build its first major new facility in a century while staying in its historic lower-Manhattan neighborhood.The city and state are putting up a record $560 million in subsidies, tax breaks and other benefits to build a 60-story office tower, including a state-of-the-art trading facility, across from the Big Board's current home at Broad and Wall streets.The long-expected agreement is critical to both city and exchange. The stock exchange gets vital space to add more foreign stocks and trading technology, while the city and state retain the institution that defines the New York City financial district, which has only recently recovered from the early 1990s real-estate recession.But the deal also carries risks for both sides. The Big Board, by far the world's biggest stock market, is prospering now, but its "open outcry" system of trading stocks on a physical floor faces serious challenges from electronic-trading systems. Such systems have prompted many foreign markets to scrap their floors entirely. And though it is the financial district's first new office tower in 10 years, signs of a slowing economy have made speculative new construction risky, and some projects are already being called off around the country.The agreement, announced jointly yesterday by the state, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Big Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Grasso, is subject to a more definitive agreement and to approval by the exchange's board. Under the deal, the city and state will acquire a site across Broad Street now primarily occupied by J.P. Morgan & Co. and find a developer to build the tower.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The much-anticipated second-half rebound in economic activity shows signs of materializing.Some key real-time economic indicators improved during the early weeks of July.Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said yesterday that sales in July are tracking at the high end of management's expectations. The company is expecting that stores open at least one year will report a 2% to 4% monthly increase in sales from a year earlier. The company said it is making up for weaker seasonal sales recorded in May and June. The Northeast is especially strong.Meanwhile, the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a private research institute, said its weekly index of leading economic indicators climbed in mid-July to its highest level since early April 2000. The index -- which tracks a range of financial and economic indicators -- is growing at its fastest rate since 1987."The window of [economic] vulnerability that the index picked up earlier in the year has slammed shut," said Lakshman Achuthan, the group's managing director.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mail service is becoming slower, more expensive and less reliable. No matter what the outcome of the current contract standoff between postal management and unions, the Postal Service wants to raise the first-class rate to 23 cents early next year -- up 53% since 1981 and 666% since 1958, far faster than the inflation rate. First-class mail delivery is 10% slower than it was 15 years ago, and Postmaster General William Bolger concedes that postal delivery may have been more reliable in the 1920s.Even if politicians insist on preserving the government's mail monopoly, there are far cheaper ways to deliver mail. The Postal Service already contracts out 4,800 delivery routes to private carriers, thereby saving up to two-thirds of its usual costs, according to John C. Maraney of the National Star Route Mail Carriers Association. Postal Rate Commissioner John Crutcher says that had postal wage increases since 1970 not been so excessive, a first-class stamp would now cost only 15 cents or 16 cents. Since 84% of the Postal Service's costs are labor, contracting out would save a large portion of its $25 billion budget.The current system is forcing people to pay more and more for less and less service. Negotiations between the Postal Service and the unions on a new labor contract have broken down, and arbitration is likely. A strike is feared. The only certainty is that the government mail monopoly will still be a public nuisance.For 20 years, one postal reform after another has failed to produce good service at stable prices. The Post Office was a national embarrassment in the 1960s. In 1970 it was changed from a cabinet department to a quasi-government corporation, and renamed the Postal Service. But as a bureaucracy it is still sluggish.The Postmaster General and his army of aides work overtime to obscure the Postal Service's meager performance. Mr. Bolger says that postal productivity is up 34% since 1970, and is still rising at a 3% to 4% annual clip. To put it kindly, Mr. Bolger has yet to corner the market on veracity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Amid softening home prices, rising foreclosures and turmoil in the mortgage industry, billionaire financier Carl Icahn is making a contrarian bet on a troubled pocket of the U.S. housing market: high- end Florida condominiums.How Mr. Icahn fares with his wager could help answer whether this state's housing downturn is a cloud that will soon blow over or a storm that will linger for years. The board of WCI Communities Inc., a home builder that has erected hundreds of high-rise condos along the Florida coast, could decide today whether to accept Mr. Icahn's tender offer of $22 a share for the builder that many consider a good barometer for the state's priciest real estate. That offer, which totals about $920 million, is slightly higher than WCI's $21.45 price yesterday in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.Mr. Icahn's pursuit of WCI has puzzled many on Wall Street who believe the Bonita Springs, Fla., company is highly exposed to the swelling glut of condos dotting Florida beaches and golf courses. In the fourth quarter, WCI, which has a market value of about $909 million, had more defaults on condos and cancellations of typical single-family homes, which it also builds, than it received orders for new homes.Mr. Icahn appears to be counting on Florida real estate to make a comeback. "My investment philosophy, generally, with exceptions, is to buy something when no one wants it," he said yesterday. "We made a fairly large investment and took control of several energy companies seven or eight years ago when they were way down. Housing is somewhat analogous."Mr. Icahn, who has put up a slate of nominees for the WCI board, declines to comment on what, if any, plans he has for the company. In a Jan. 16 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Icahn said he beneficially held 14.5%, or 6.1 million shares, in WCI and that he intended to contact the company to discuss how to "unlock the inherent value" of its shares. His tender offer is conditioned on the WCI board pulling its recently enacted poison-pill provision intended to ward off hostile takeovers. WCI declined to comment, citing a "quiet period" after the tender offer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Investors may be talking bearish, but they're still walking bullish.During the past two months, the level of negative sentiment -- at least as articulated by the assorted seers and chin-scratchers on Wall Street -- has grown noticeably. Strategists bullish throughout 1995's impressive stock market run have grown increasingly skittish about the market's prospects for the rest of this year. Among the reasons bearishness is so in vogue: speculative movement among small stocks and an overly aggressive investor lust for initial public offerings of any kind.But at the same time, even as the talk grows more pessimistic, the folks with the hard cash continue to remain, well, fairly bullish. Mutual fund cash inflows are powerfully strong. Cash levels among institutional investors are stuck at aggressively low levels. Money managers, while nervously talking about rising interest rates and stretched valuations, continue to deploy new assets into the stock market. And analysts' estimates for 1996 earnings for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index companies have risen in four of the past five weeks, according to I/B/E/S International Inc., a research firm in New York."People are talking a lot about being more nervous, but I sure don't see it reflected in the stock prices," says Barbara Marcin, senior equity portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management. "Part of the problem is that people are afraid of being out of the market. Though investors are talking more pessimistically, the one thing we've learned during the past year and a half is that being in cash is not the place to be."Yes, holding cash can be deadly, which might explain why it's easier to try to call a market top than it is to move investments to reflect such sentiment. Jeffrey Vinik, late of Fidelity's Magellan Fund, learned the hard way that playing defense in this market can be immensely unrewarding. And many of the most outspoken and nervous bears concede that they have felt nervous and bearish for a long time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This may come as a surprise to those of you who have bought anything in Connecticut recently, but: The state is a pretty affordable place to live.How can that be? After all, prices in Connecticut for everything from utilities to groceries and health care are 22% higher than the nationwide average, according to an index compiled by the latest edition of the Connecticut Economy, a quarterly publication from the University of Connecticut. Only Massachusetts and Alaska have higher cost-of-living indexes, says economist Steven Lanza, managing editor of the review.But, Mr. Lanza says, that only tells part of the story. Prices by themselves are meaningless. "They're high here, low there, but what does that really tell you?" Mr. Lanza says. "You have to look at purchasing power."According to the U.S. Commerce Department's most recent figures, Connecticut leads the nation in per-capita personal income. At $33,875 a year, income is 39% above the national average."So prices are relatively high here," Mr. Lanza says, "but incomes are higher still."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The stock market snapped a five-day losing streak with a vengeance, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 75.23 points, a record single-day advance.Up only a modest 17 points around 2 p.m. EDT, the industrial average zoomed in the final two hours to close at 2568.05. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a heavy 209.5 million shares. The gain, amounting to some 3%, ended a five-session tailspin in which the average lost more than 120 points, 31 of them on Monday.Bullish investors were encouraged by the dollar's advance against other currencies, especially the yen, and a solid gain in bond prices -- both of which were interpreted as signs that interest rates might not rise as much as had been feared.Higher interest rates are anathema to stocks. Rising or high rates make bonds look more attractive than stocks to many investors, and eventually choke off the economic growth that fuels increases in corporate profits. A rise in the dollar is widely viewed as lessening pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates."I think this market was just waiting for some good news," said Laszlo Birinyi, head of equity market analysis with Salomon Brothers. According to his flow-of-funds calculations, a net of $1.1 billion was invested in stocks yesterday, making it the fourth best day in history on that basis.

    <TEXT>Only a few months ago, it was common to hear that the only thing holding the dollar up was massive buying by foreign central banks. On April 18, for example, a typical article in a British journal suggested that in the preceding year, Treasury Secretary Baker "has taken out balance of payments insurance by persuading foreign central banks to suppress an upsurge of American interest rates by purchasing nearly $200 billion of U.S. securities" (emphasis added). If the central banks ever stopped financing our trade deficit by buying Treasury securities, the experts agreed, then the dollar would drop by 30% and interest rates would soar.Now, however, foreign central banks are not only not buying dollars, but instead selling billions. Yet the dollar nonetheless remains quite strong, and U.S. bond yields have gone down, not up. If it really required $100 billion to $200 billion of intervention to prop up the dollar, how can things have suddenly changed so much? Much credit for the dollar's firming is given to recent dramatic narrowing of the monthly trade-deficit figures. But in actual dollar terms, that is not the big story.What has changed in the first half of 1988 appears to be mainly the capital account (investment) rather than the current account (trade). Americans are investing less abroad, leaving fewer foreign transactions to finance by selling dollars, while foreigners are investing more in the U.S., and thus buying dollars to finance those investments. The U.S. is clearly looking relatively more attractive to world investors. Bond prices have recently increased in the U.S., but fallen in Germany, the U.K. and Japan. Stock prices are also near this year's peak in the U.S., but the largest foreign stock markets are well below their peaks when measured in U.S. dollars.Of course, the dollar's rise and the improved picture for U.S. investments are mutually reinforcing -- it is hard to pinpoint where the chicken-and-egg cycle began. But by itself, the stronger dollar should take some competitive pricing pressure off the industries of countries such as Germany and Japan, thus helping their stocks. So, the fact that their markets nonetheless remain much weaker than those here, when measured in the same currency, indicates that discounted profit opportunities look stronger in the U.S.The U.S. is not alone. Canada, Australia and, until recently, the United Kingdom all experienced sharp increases in both their currencies and stock markets this year, relative to Continental Europe. Interestingly, Canada and the U.S. both reduced marginal tax rates in January, while Australia announced lower tax rates for the near future. The British pound first soared on the news that the top tax rate would soon drop to 40% from 60%, but there has since been considerable uncertainty about new taxes in both Britain and Germany.</TEXT>

But the currency rebounded Wednesday when Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said the dollar had "fallen enough."Mr. Volcker's comments spooked a group of traders holding short, or oversold, positions, Wednesday, and sent them scrambling to cover those exposures.Dealers and analysts said they expect the currency to level off in the near term, but then gradually fall. "People are much more cautious and much less sure of a decline in the dollar," said Peter Wild, vice president of foreign exchange for Bank Julius Baer & Co., New York.

    <TEXT>Given last week's grim jobs report, it's now clearer than ever that the November election will be a referendum on the economy. Has the president's program worked? Does Mitt Romney have a better program to promote job creation and prosperity? Fortunately, Americans have evidence that will allow them not only to judge President Obama's economic performance, but also to compare that performance with Mr. Romney's proposed alternative.Twice in postwar America, deep recessions have driven the unemployment rate to 10%. In the 1981-82 recession, the unemployment rate soared to 10.8%. In the 2007-09 recession, it peaked at 10%.Both downturns were rooted in financial convulsions. The 1981-82 recession was induced by restrictive monetary policy aimed at breaking the back of double-digit inflation and interest rates, which generated a housing and savings-and-loan crisis. The more recent recession resulted from excessive government intervention to increase homeownership by expanding subprime housing loans, on which substantial leverage was built. The resulting wave of defaults damaged the base of the banking system.Fifty-three months after the start of the 1981-82 recession, total employment in the U.S. was up 7.5 million, or almost 7.5% higher than when the recession began. The labor-force participation rate rose to 65% from 63.8%, as optimism about the future pulled potential workers into the job market. Real per capita gross domestic product increased by $2,870 and was 11% higher than when the recession started.Fifty-three months after the start of the 2007-09 recession, however, total employment in the U.S. is still down four million jobs, or 2.7% lower than when the recession began. The labor-force participation rate has dropped to 63.8% from 66%, as discouraged workers have exited the labor market. Real per capita GDP has declined by $964 and is 2.2% lower today than when the recession began.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seven years after the U.S.-led invasion, Iraq's petroleum industry shows signs of living up to the potential that American planners hoped for at the start of the military operation, a potential boost to the war-ravaged country's economic recovery.After fits and starts, Iraq's oil production has rebounded to prewar levels. The government thinks the field-development deals it has handed out to international companies are on the way to boosting output significantly. With Iraq depending on oil exports for some 90% of its government revenue, that is expected to provide a broader boost to an economy that is already benefiting from high growth and tame inflation.No one is predicting an economic miracle in Iraq, which is still smarting from decades of sanctions, underinvestment and a creaky, centrally planned economy. Unemployment remains high, posing a continued risk that jobless youth will be lured to the insurgency. Power outages are common, leaving residents sweltering in darkness and complaining at times that things were better before the invasion.The Bush administration denied going to war over oil. But senior officials in Washington suggested early in the military operation that Iraq's oil wealth offered a quick way to rebuild.Years of trying to lure outside capital and know-how, however, foundered. During the invasion, oil production went to zero. Afterward, the country's oil infrastructure and power grid -- never reliable in the first place -- were heavily looted. Then, political opposition to foreign involvement in the country's oil fields flared.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In your Nov. 16 Technology Journal article "Outsourcing Firms Shift Gears in Tight Market," the outsourcing development may be quite positive for the industry. As you point out, the U.S. outsourcing market is changing and 1999 revenues that were inflated by Y2K and ERP spending are unlikely to reappear anytime soon. Nevertheless, there are many positive trends, including global expansion of outsourcing to offset slower growth in a more mature U.S. market, greater spending on infrastructure, applications management and network services to facilitate the transition to e-business, and an aging federal information technology staff that will accelerate federal sector outsourcing, especially to enable e-government.If the so-called outsourcing dinosaurs have been outflanked by their smaller, newer competitors, the tide may well be reversing in favor of size, broad experience and financial staying power as the scramble for qualified IT staff intensifies. At a time when corporate IT departments and governmental agencies alike are confronting a work force nearing retirement, new IT graduates favor established outsourcers and shun the civil service. This will only intensify the trend toward outsourcing.If so, stock investors would be well advised to adopt a longer-term investment horizon. Announcements of layoffs should be understood as normal repositionings by outsourcers that acquire new staff with each contract win. They don't necessarily presage revenue shortfalls, and the growth of revenues from non-U.S. market doesn't signal a souring of the U.S. market.Albert NekimkenVice President</TEXT>
