    <TEXT>[Today's Market Forecast]Mortal CoilThe good news about last year's flat stock market? Stocks got cheaper. The bad news? They could get cheaper still.In 2005, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had one of the most uninspiring annual performances of its 109-year history, finishing the year down 0.6% -- which is to say almost perfectly flat. The broader market did a bit better, but with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gaining 3%, it, too, drew yawns rather than applause.But even as the market treaded water, corporate profits grew quickly. Company analysts polled by Reuters Estimates predict that earnings for companies in the S&P 500 increased 13.6% in 2005. Because the S&P 500 went up less than its earnings, it's price/earnings ratio slipped. On Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 16.4 times 2005 earnings. It finished 2004 at 18 times that year's earnings. In fact, it's the lowest S&P 500 P/E ratio in 10 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Money-market mutual funds have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity this year. Their assets may never return to the record levels reached in the fall of 1982, shortly before banks were allowed to offer competing "money market accounts." But the floundering stock market, the rise in interest rates and a rate advantage over the bank competitors have led consumers to increase their holdings of these easy-access, market-rate investments.Investors shouldn't assume that the more than 300 money funds are all alike. The funds can differ in such things as their minimums for investment and check-writing and the ease of getting through to customer-service people on the telephone. Perhaps more important, they also vary widely in the types of short-term assets they buy. These differences produce varying yields and levels of risk."Money funds are looked at as a homogeneous, commodity-type product. But when you look at them closely, you see there are really big differences in risk and management policy," says Edward A. Taber III, money-fund portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.Consumers haven't had to become aware of the risk differences because the money funds have an excellent safety record. No fund has ever owned a security that defaulted. Investors suffered a 6% decline in principal in one small fund several years ago, but that was because the fund had extended the maturity of its holdings to the point that many would say it wasn't even a money fund anymore. Nevertheless, there conceivably could be principal losses in a money fund, so investors should be aware of how much risk their particular fund is taking.The most common type of money fund is one that invests in a diversified portfolio of short-term government securities, bank certificates of deposit and corporate obligations called "commercial paper." Other funds stick to the safety of government obligations. There also are big distinctions within each category. Yields generally rise with the risk of the investments, as shown in the accompanying data from Donoghue's Money Fund Report.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's nominees to the Federal Reserve Board stressed the importance of fighting a weak economy, indicating support for policies aimed at reducing the high unemployment rate."Over the next few years, the Fed must craft policies that ensure that our economy accelerates its progress along the recovery path it has begun to trace," Janet Yellen, the nominee for Fed vice chairman who has served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco since 2004, told the Senate Banking Committee. "With unemployment still painfully high, job creation must be a high priority of monetary policy."Ms. Yellen appeared at a confirmation hearing Thursday alongside two other nominees to become Fed governors: Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Peter Diamond and Maryland financial regulator Sarah Bloom Raskin.If confirmed to the seven-member Fed board, the trio would likely push the balance of power at the Fed toward those who worry more that the economy isn't expanding quickly enough rather than those worried about the risk of unwelcome inflation.Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) noted that recent data suggested that the economy was moving toward price deflation. "It is evident that the economy is going to need all the help the Fed can provide over the coming year," he said.</TEXT>
