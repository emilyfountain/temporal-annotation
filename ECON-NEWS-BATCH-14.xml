    <TEXT>I read with much interest the article about the Supreme Court raising its fee limit for court-appointed attorneys in capital cases to $5,000 {Jan. 25.} While I share some of the anger and indignation of Vivian Berger, the Columbia Law professor who "won" the increase, I also believe her anger is somewhat misdirected.As a law student at Georgetown University who plans to serve indigent clients when I graduate, I know all too well the dearth of legal resources for have-nots. In addition to the fact that the pay is incredibly low (in many cases probably lower than the $17 per hour Vivian Berger received in her case), the funding is so limited that many lawyers who would like to practice in the Public Defender Service or legal services agencies must be turned away.But with all this inequity, I'm not really sure the government is the best place to seek change. Certainly Vivian Berger was correct in stating that the Supreme Court sends a powerful message in setting attorney fees. But those cases are paid for by the government of a country that is in a recession and that has proved quite well that it cannot manage its finances. Meanwhile, she is surrounded in New York (as we are here in Washington) by hundreds if not thousands of lawyers who are charging $395 per hour. I have yet to meet a human being whose abilities are worth $395 an hour. Isn't there a better way to spend that kind of money?In theory, lawyers are to adhere to standards of professional responsibility. I quote from the ABA's Model Code of Professional Responsibility, Ethical Consideration 2-25: "Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional workload, should find time to participate in serving the disadvantaged. The rendition of free legal services to those unable to pay reasonable fees continues to be an obligation of each lawyer, but the efforts of individual lawyers are often not enough to meet the need."Now, I suspect that most of the lawyers in this country who are charging fees of $200 and up per hour have limited expertise in criminal law. But that need not foreclose their aid to indigent clients. Through their firms, they could establish legal defense funds: they could hire one or more associates per year who would specialize in criminal defense and thereby carry the bulk of the firm's legal aid obligation. They could target current associates and partners with an interest in criminal law, free them for additional training if needed and credit their billable time for their efforts on behalf of indigents - without limit. And criminal law need not be the only area in which law firms do more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The issue of trade policy -- as critical to the nation's future as Iraq and every bit as divisive -- is now squarely before the Democratic Congress. It will almost certainly provide a huge challenge to its leadership.The stage was set by a painfully negotiated deal between the White House and Democrats, announced last week, on the terms of trade in pending agreements with Peru and Panama. Those agreements with two small nations are just the overture for a much larger debate involving tariff-cutting deals with Colombia and South Korea. And then comes the monumental question of whether to give President Bush the same free hand that his predecessors have enjoyed in negotiating global and regional trade agreements, not amendable by Congress but subject only to an up-or-down vote.Before last week, there was no chance that a Democratic Congress would trust Bush to look out for the interests of American firms and workers in any such negotiations. Now there is a chance -- but only a chance -- that the United States will be able to take its usual leadership role in moving the world toward an open trading system.What created this opportunity was that after months of saying no, the lead negotiators for the White House, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab finally said yes to the inclusion of labor and environmental guarantees in the body of the trade agreements.Such provisions -- requiring signatories to enforce internationally recognized standards banning child labor and prison labor and permitting union organizing, as well as requiring enforcement of their own environmental laws -- had been included in the final trade agreements negotiated by the Clinton administration and approved by Congress.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Despite solid U.S. economic growth and low inflation, the dollar yesterday fell to its lowest level in more than two years against the German mark.A combination of factors, including some that have little to do with the United States directly, have been hammering the dollar. These include the peso crisis in Mexico and an expected rise in German interest rates. Whatever the causes, the sagging dollar is beginning to ring alarm bells among top U.S. officials.The dollar's weakness promoted an unusual expression of concern this week from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The Fed, Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee, will be watching the dollar's value closely in coming months.President Clinton, at a press conference yesterday in Ottawa with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, observed, "Well, the truth is that all of us have . . . something less than 100 percent control over the value of our currency. . . . I was stunned last year when the value of the American dollar went down when we were having 4 percent growth, the best economic year in 10 years, {and} the lowest combined inflation-unemployment rate in almost 30 years."In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4618 marks, down from 1.4675 late Thursday, the Associated Press reported. The dollar improved slightly against the yen and was changing hands at 97.00 yen, up from 96.71. The dollar's record low against the Japanese currency was 96.12, reached Nov. 2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The federal government posted its largest monthly budget deficit on record in Marcli with a $53.34 billion imbalance, the Treasury Department reported yesterday.The March gap between spending and revenue pushed the deficit for the first six months of the fiscal year past the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction target for all of fiscal 1990.Louis Crandall, an economist with R.H. Wrightson of New York, said the deficit so far this year points to a return to $200 billion imbalances that existed until recently.Crandall attributed most of the March deficit to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. payments, spending by the Resolution Trust Corp. to bail out failed savings and loans, expedited income tax refunds as a result of electronic filing systems and government losses because of the fallingThe March figure boosted the deficit to $150.85 billion for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. This was 17.5	percent more than the $128.4 billion imbalance during the first half of 1989 and well above the Gramm-Rudman 1990 target of $100 billion.</TEXT>
