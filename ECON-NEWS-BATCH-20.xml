    <TEXT>In my last two articles, I examined the Federal Reserve Board's proposals for tightening mortgage underwriting requirements and for limiting mortgage broker charges to borrowers. These are long-standing regulatory concerns.In contrast, the Fed seems to have discovered mortgage servicing abuses only recently. The regulatory proposals are weak, but they are a good first step.One proposal would require that servicers credit payments on the days payments are received. Another would require servicers to provide accurate payoff statements within a reasonable time to borrowers who intend to pay off their loans. Both are fair, clear and not onerous for the lender.A third proposal would prohibit servicers from imposing late fees or delinquency charges when scheduled payments are received on time but do not include previous late charges. This rule would eliminate the practice of "pyramiding late fees," in which servicers continue to charge late fees until all previous late fees have been paid.But the proposal does not cover a worse type of pyramiding. When a scheduled payment is received on time but the escrow payment is short, the practice is to place the entire payment in a suspense account, charge the borrower a late fee and send a delinquency notice to the credit bureaus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like many real estate company executives, James J. Wilson, president and chief executive of Interstate General Co. L.P. in St. Charles, Md., worries about interest rates and federal policies that affect consumer demand for the homes his company builds and the lots it sells.Wilson fretted so much about the federal budget deficit last year that he voted for Ross Perot, he said, even though he didn't want the Texan to win. "You have to know what's going on at all levels [of government]. It's going to come back and affect you," Wilson said.He almost learned that lesson the hard way. Since going public in February 1987, the company Wilson founded in 1957 had posted a healthy string of profits until the fourth quarter of 1990, when it lost $473,000.The last two years were difficult. The worst came in the second quarter of 1992, when the company lost $16.2 million. Interstate General would have filed for bankruptcy, like many other developers, except for its racetrack and off-track-betting operation in Puerto Rico, and the revenue it made on the 8,000 apartment units it owns, Wilson said.Total revenue also declined, from a high of $64.4 million in 1990 to $41 million last year. Now, as quarterly profits are returning to the black ($2.3 million in the first quarter of the year), Wilson said he has decided to shift Interstate General's focus from home building and land development because they are so dependent on government actions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The House and Senate Bank-iijg Committees yesterday voted to give President Ford the anti - inflation monitoring agency he requested Monday night.Members of both committees agreed that they were not giving the President any authority he did not already have, since hp could establish such a task force by executive order, But the consensus on botli committees was that it could not do any harm and since it was Mr. Ford۪s first request as President he should have it.Both Mouse and Senate arc] expected to vote Monday on their respective versions of the monitoring agency bill. Although the thrust of both proposals is the same, there are enough diferences to require a conference to shape a bill acceptable to both chambers.Both versions of the bill authorize Mr. Ford to set up a White House council to monitor wage and price developments and collect data on various sectors of the economy, in order to pinpoint both private and government sources of inflation.The proposed agency will, in effect, take the place of the larger and more powerful Cost of Living Council, which went out of existence .June 30. This agency would not have the power to impose mandatory wage and price controls, which the old Cost of Living Council had until April 30.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people look forward to daylight savings time. Others await baseball's opening pitch. Loop Fans, of course, look forward to the annual presentation of the "Congressional Pig Book," with its listing of the most egregious pork-barrel projects from this year's appropriations bills.The 12th annual rollout on Tuesday, complete with hogs of the four-legged variety and a list of the "Dirty Dozen" -- 12 states that have received the most pork per capita from 1995 to 2002 -- promises to be the best ever. That's because we're hailing record- breaking amounts of pork, 8,341 projects, and a record total of $20.1 billion in chops, ham, roasts and bacon, according to the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste.$14 million for the appropriately named Hollings Marine Laboratory in South Carolina -- as in Sen.

    <TEXT>White House anti-inflation czar Robert S. Strauss said yesterday President Carter should adopt the toughest possible" wage-price program he can, and not listen to those who contend it would hurt him politically.At a breakfast meeting with reporters. Strauss said the best politics۪* for Carter would be to propose a tough, tough, do-able program" that asks significant۝ sacrifices from all sectors of the economy.I think if he came up with a year of national denial, of national austerity. the public would buy it, business would buy it and labor would buy it," Strauss said. The president has to lay it on the line.۝Strauss۪ remarks essentially countered those of another White House official on Monday who cautioned that a stringent guidelines program might prove Carter۪s political undoing," and urged the plan be weakened.The developments came as Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall, trying to assure organized labor, yesterday told a steel workers۪ union convention the administration۪s new wage-price program won۪t burden labor more than other groups.</TEXT>
