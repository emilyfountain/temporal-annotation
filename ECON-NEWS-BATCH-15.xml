    <TEXT>In a city that keeps close tabs on what's in and what's out, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker made it official yesterday: M1 is out.Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee, which Proxmire chairs, that the Fed will no longer target the growth of M1, a basic measure of the nation's money supply.But Proxmire is one of M1's biggest fans. And he told Volcker the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins law requires the Fed to report to Congress on the rate at which it wants the basic money supply to grow.Proxmire questioned the legality of the Fed's refusal to provide an M1 target but said that he would try to use quiet diplomacy to get the central bank to change its position.M1 consists of money involved in transactions-currency, checking accounts and travelers checks-and according to some economists is linked to economic growth: If money supply expands, growth increases; if it shrinks, the economy contracts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Federal Reserve, concerned that the economy's sluggish growth could signal a possible recession, yesterday cut short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point -- its first move to lower rates in nearly three years.The dramatic turn in interest rate policy was announced by the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee. It said it would cut the federal funds rate, the interest rate financial institutions charge on overnight loans to each other, to 5.75 percent from 6 percent.Several banks immediately said they would follow the Fed's lead and reduce their 9 percent prime lending rate to 8.75 percent, effective today. The reduction will benefit many small-business borrowers and consumers with home equity loans and credit card balances, whose rates typically are tied to the prime.The Fed's announcement had been anxiously awaited on Wall Street, following weeks of speculation about how the Fed would react to signs that the economy was weakening. Both stock and bond markets surged after the 2:15 p.m. announcement, with the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 industrial stocks gaining 48.77 points to close at a record high of 4664.00.The Fed's move to cut rates yesterday ended a cycle of tightening that began in February 1994. Over the next 12 months, the Fed raised short-term rates seven times, lifting the federal funds rates from 3 percent to 6 percent, in what Fed officials said was an effort to slow economic growth before it triggered a surge of inflation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For many, taking a sick day requires little thought. But by most estimates, nearly half of all private-sector workers in the United States do not have a single day of paid sick leave. And more do not have a paid day off that can be used to care for a sick child.Low-wage workers are hit the hardest, with three of every four lacking any paid sick leave. They also usually have no health-care coverage or work a full-time or more than full-time schedule of piecemeal, part-time jobs, making paid sick leave even more unlikely.When workers without sick leave get a virus or an injury, they have to decide if they can take an unpaid day off and still make the rent. If not, they often return to their jobs as security guards, cooks, waitresses and cashiers -- decreasing their productivity and possibly getting others sick. Paid sick days can reduce turnover, cut down on health-care costs (although most companies that don't provide paid sick leave also don't provide health-care coverage), and increase productivity and morale.There was movement on the paid-sick-day front last month. More than 60 percent of voters in San Francisco approved a ballot measure that would require all businesses with fewer than 10 workers to give employees up to 40 hours of paid sick leave a year; for larger employers, up to 72 hours. At every company, an employee will accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, so both part- time and full-time workers would be covered.It probably won't end with San Francisco. There is a push to get similar measures in front of decision makers in other cities and states in the coming year, including in the District.</TEXT>
