    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Yields on most certificates of deposit offered by major banks dropped more than a tenth of a percentage point in the latest week, reflecting the overall decline in short-term interest rates.On small-denomination, or "consumer," CDs sold directly by banks, the average yield on six-month deposits fell to 5.49% from 5.62% in the week ended yesterday, according to an 18-bank survey by Banxquote Money Markets, a Wilmington, Del., information service.On three-month "consumer" deposits, the average yield sank to 5.29% from 5.42% the week before, according to Banxquote. Two banks in the Banxquote survey, Citibank in New York and CoreStates in Pennsylvania, are paying less than 5% on threemonth small-denomination CDs.Declines were somewhat smaller on five-year consumer CDs, which eased to 7.37% from 7.45%, Banxquote said.Yields on three-month and six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction plummeted more than a fifth of a percentage point from the previous week, to 5.46% and 5.63%, respectively.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The statistics on the enormous costs of employee drug abuse are well known (at least $70 billion per year, according to December 1985 testimony before the House Labor Subcommittee on Health and Safety). Management is under pressure to reduce productivity losses, turnover, insurance costs and the risk of lawsuits for personal and property damage caused by drug-impaired workers. Management also is under sales pressure from a growing cadre of laboratories, test-kit manufacturers and consultants who extol the virtues of testing. A common argument is the following: "Your competitors are starting to require drug tests. If you don't, their work force will be clean and you will end up with all the junkies."Many companies that have implemented widespread drug-testing programs, however, have learned that there is a downside to testing. They have experienced the protests of employees and civil libertarians and have watched the proliferation of lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy, defamation and other legal theories. A Texas railroad employee was awarded $200,000 in damages when his employer misreported the results of a drug test. Numerous other cases are pending.Is there a middle ground? Can safety and efficiency be protected without invading the privacy of applicants and employees?A growing number of companies have concluded that drug testing should be the least important part of a comprehensive drug-abuse program. The starting point is a drug-awareness program to educate managers, supervisors and employees about the dangers and signs of drug abuse. The second part of the program is an effective employee-assistance program (EAP). Rehabilitation is preferable to punishment or dismissal (at least for initial or nonserious offenses) because it encourages employees to seek help voluntarily, improves labor relations and is cost-effective by restoring valuable employees to productive status. More than one company that heedlessly adopted a "screen and fire" policy on drugs had second thoughts after discovering traces of drugs in some of their most productive employees.There may be a place for drug testing in a company's drug-abuse program, but there are limits to the effectiveness of testing. To begin with, the accuracy of some drug tests varies widely, and the test results are often unacceptable even when performed by professional laboratories. Last year the Centers for Disease Control published the results of a 10-year study of laboratory testing for amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, codeine, methadone and morphine. Virtually all of the laboratories in the study had unacceptably high error rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TORONTO -- Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal posted increased net incomes for their fiscal second quarters as prudence helped them weather the recent economic slowdown and stock-market volatility.Canadian banks have fared better than their U.S. counterparts as the economy has soured, partly because the Canadian companies had less exposure to deteriorating credit. "Canadian banks are relatively cautious," said Kevin Choquette, a Toronto analyst with Scotia Capital, the brokerage arm of Bank of Nova Scotia.Credit problems for Canadian banks have also been milder because Canada emerged a year later than the U.S. from the last recession, Mr. Choquette added. That lag gave U.S. banks "an extra year to put on more marginal credit," he said.For the quarter ended April 30, Royal Bank, based in Toronto, said net increased 4% to 602 million Canadian dollars (US$390.8 million), or 92 Canadian cents a fully diluted share, from C$578 million, or 89 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier. Royal Bank's total provision for credit losses rose to C$210 million from C$172 million in the year-earlier period.Results for the latest quarter included, for the first time, a full quarter of earnings for two recently acquired businesses: Dain Rauscher, a Minneapolis securities firm, and the insurance subsidiaries of South Carolina's Liberty Corp. While Dain Rauscher's results contributed to a 42% drop in Royal Bank's wealth-management earnings, the Liberty acquisitions' results fueled a 63% jump in insurance earnings. Personal- and commercial-banking earnings rose 26% to C$334 million.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The U.S. dollar declined against most major foreign currencies yesterday, although the drop was softened when bond prices failed to advance Tuesday's rally.The dollar began weakening in Europe as interest rates fell there for dollar deposits. The decline continued in New York trading, which was thin, although the dollar recovered slightly when bond prices began falling. Lower bond prices translate into higher long-term interest yields, which make dollar denominated investments more attractive. The bond market later closed little-changed from Tuesday."This is the first time in a while that we've gone back to trading off interest rates, and my feeling is it will continue between now and the (U.S.) election," said Daniel Holland, an assistant vice president at Discount Corp., New York.In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 3.0210 West German marks from 3.0318 marks on Tuesday. The British pound rose to $1.2223 from $1.2155.In early Tokyo trading Thursday, the dollar strengthened against the Japanese currency, to 245.45 yen from 245.13 yen late yesterday in New York.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: James B. StewartThe dreaded "D" word is back in circulation, and I don't mean "depression." Having skirted that potential calamity, the worry for policy makers and investors now is deflation.On the face of it, deflation--falling prices--doesn't seem like it would be so bad. Who wouldn't welcome discounts that just keep getting better, like those sales at Filene's Basement where prices got lower the longer merchandise stayed on the racks?Of course, who knows what it really feels like, since most of us have never experienced prolonged deflation in our lifetime.Maybe deflation would be a nice thing for people with secure, steady incomes. But deflation erodes profits and asset values. People wait to buy expecting lower prices, reducing demand. Lower profits cause companies to cut expenses, including employees. It is a downward spiral that, if Japan's experience is any indication, is difficult to arrest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to Kevin A. Hassett and Aparna Mathur's(op-ed, Oct. 25), analyses showing growing inequality in the U.S. err by focusing largely "on pretax incomes while ignoring the transfer payments and spending from unemployment insurance, food stamps, Medicaid and other safety-net programs." The authors tell us that in measuring inequality, we should look to consumption rather than pretax cash income. This, allegedly, is because consumption "will be set by consumers with an eye on their lifetime incomes."Oh, really? How about single parents, pensioners or enlisted military personnel who resort to payday loans? Their consumption is set with an eye on their immediate, pressing needs, not their lifetime incomes.The authors seem to think that inequality can be measured by the quantity of washing machines or microwaves in poor homes. They don't consider debt levels. They seem unacquainted with foreclosures. They show no interest in future prospects.Most remarkable of all, the authors would undo the very basis of the equality, such as it is, that they perceive in America. The safety net? Trash it, or at least "reshape" it.So I guess what Mr. Hassett and Ms. Mathur really believe is that if the extent of inequality isn't so bad after all--how silly of we liberals to think otherwise. We should change that right away.</TEXT>

The tension over her situation sometimes spills over in arguments with her sister over housework or their shared space. And with her 34-year-old boyfriend subsisting on short-term contracts, Ms. Violano doesn't even dare dream of building the sort of life her parents took for granted."For our parents, everything was much easier," she says. "They had the opportunity to start their own life.

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- While acknowledging that the pace of economic recovery "has been little more than glacial," Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan refused to take blame for the recession.In an appearance before Congress's Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Greenspan said he couldn't think of one policy decision the Fed has made that he would like "to go back and revisit.""If you were doing it all over again, you'd do it the same way?" asked Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), vice chairman of the panel."I would -- with the knowledge we had at the particular times as things evolved," the Fed chairman replied.Members of Congress from both parties and the Bush administration recently have intensified their criticism of the Fed for not lowering interest rates aggressively enough. The last rate reduction was made in December, and there was nothing in the chairman's remarks to indicate whether the Fed plans any further moves on interest rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- In a sign that inflation remains under control even as the economy regains momentum, prices at the wholesale level dropped 0.2% in November, the Labor Department said.The fall in the producer price index was caused by a big 1.5% drop in energy costs, reflecting the recent weakness in crude oil prices, and a 0.5% decline in food prices. Excluding these volatile sectors, producer prices edged up 0.1% in November after dropping 0.1% the month before. For the year ended in November, wholesale prices rose 1.3%.Analysts said the latest inflation report indicates wholesalers are refusing to raise prices even as demand for their goods is picking up."Wholesalers and retailers are competing on a price containment basis," said Samuel Kahan, chief economist of Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. "Instead, they are making profits through productivity gains."Prices were subdued across the board last month. Consumer goods and capital equipment showed moderation in pricing. There was a 1% rise in the price of passenger cars last month, following a drop of 2.3% in October. Prices for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production in November dropped for the second straight month. Excluding food and energy, prices of intermediate goods were unchanged in November while prices of crude goods declined 0.9%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Consumer credit in July continued to grow at a rapid rate, although the pace was slower than in the previous two months, the Federal Reserve Board said.Consumer credit increased a seasonally adjusted $7.11 billion in July, the board said, after rising $7.83 billion in June and a record $10.23 billion in May.Alan Murray, vice president of Citicorp Information Services, said the July figures show that "consumer demand remains strong," despite other signs that the vigorous economic recovery may be slowing. He said the continued heavy borrowing suggests that consumer spending isn't about to decline precipitously, as some consumer-goods producers had feared.Still, Mr. Murray doesn't expect such unusually strong growth in consumer credit to continue. "With increases like these," he said, "sooner or later, the consumer has to run out of gas."The Fed report showed that consumer credit grew at a 19.75% annual rate in July, compared with an average annual pace of 24% during the second quarter and 11.5% for all of 1983. Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Co., said a further slowdown in consumer credit growth would be welcome because it would relieve upward pressure on interest rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Charlie Crist is the former governor of Florida. When he was governor he was a Republican. Now he's a Democrat and wants his old job back.Mr. Crist is expected to kick off his gubernatorial bid on Monday, thereby completing his political reinvention. He left the GOP after sliding more than 20 points in the 2010 Republican Senate primary ultimately won by Marco Rubio. After losing the Senate race as an independent, he cozied up to Democratic fundraisers and party officials. Democrats embraced him notwithstanding the rank opportunism.But then, Democrats may have their own cynical motives. Republican Gov. Rick Scott is one of their top targets in next year's midterm elections because of Florida's pivotal status as a presidential swing state. Mr. Scott, whose approval rating has consistently measured in the low 30s, also ranks as one of the country's most vulnerable governors. One reason: the governor's abrasive political style has alienated independents, which make up nearly a quarter of the state's electorate.Meantime, polls going back more than a year have suggested that Mr. Crist would have a cake walk if he were to run for his old job as a Democrat. Public Policy Polling's survey last month showed Mr. Crist leading by 12 points with a 24-point advantage among independents. What's more, Democrats have no other standard-bearer with as much statewide name recognition, fundraising prowess or cachet among independents.But the race could be a lot closer than the polls suggest. For starters, Mr. Scott can run on the state's robust economic recovery. He can point to the 500,000 jobs that Florida has added during his tenure compared to the 632,000 lost over Mr. Crist's four years in office. Meanwhile, the jobless rate has fallen to 7.0% from 10.9% since he entered office.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The spate of new jobs created by American companies last month casts doubt over the conventional wisdom that the economy is slowing.Most analysts have argued that the Asian financial crisis was beginning to rein in the galloping U.S. economy to a more manageable trot. But in the government's first official look at January economic activity, the Labor Department said Friday that nonfarm businesses added 358,000 workers to their payrolls. That was slightly more than were generated in December's robust job market and well above the healthy 267,000 average monthly rise through 1997.The employment report also showed how the rising economic tide is lifting more and more boats, with joblessness falling sharply even among high-school dropouts. For the first time, the Labor Department started reporting employment data by level of education, and said the unemployment rate for people without high-school diplomas fell to 7.2% last month from 8.9% a year earlier. Even so, the numbers confirmed that education still matters a lot: the unemployment rate for college graduates was a minuscule 1.9% last month, down from 2.1% a year earlier. (The department had been collecting these figures in the past, but not posting them.)The January unemployment rate for all workers stayed at the same 4.7% of the work force reported in December. The low jobless level continued to give workers more bargaining power, as average hourly earnings rose by four cents, to $12.51. During the past year, wages rose 3.8%, or about twice the inflation rate. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.In contrast, other data released recently indicate some sort of economic slowdown. The monthly survey of manufacturers' purchasing managers released last week showed some decline in business, as did the government's report on factory orders in December. Consumer confidence is reported to have dropped sharply in January. Anecdotal evidence -- such as disappointing profit reports and job cuts at blue-chip companies -- has added to the perception of softening. Policymakers have assumed some easing from last year's torrid growth rate was imminent. That was a big reason the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady last week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Are investors fighting the last war?In the past week's tumult, investors have favored the same sectors of the stock market that did well during the 1970s oil-price shocks and pummeled most of the same losers, according to Barra, a Berkeley, Calif., investment research firm.But a minority of investment strategists say that the market may have learned too well from the inflationary jolts of 1973-74 and 1979-80. In particular, they suggest that investors may be acting on expectations about inflation and interest rates that aren't justified by the current limping economy.The most obvious differences that set today apart, says Richard Hoey, U.S. chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is that "those two oil shocks came when the economy was closer to boom levels" and inflation was already a problem. The result in 1973-74 was "an inflation psychology that fed on itself," as businesses stocked up inventories and consumers spent like there was no tomorrow. In 1979-80, the Federal Reserve fought back with a sudden and very aggressive monetary tightening that sent interest rates into the stratosphere.Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, investors seem to be betting that soaring inflation and interest rates are going to be big problems again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW DELHI--A fund-management giant in its U.S. home market, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. is finding India tough to crack.Two years ago, T. Rowe joined a long line of Western financial firms hoping to tap into India's growing wealth and bought a large stake in the country's oldest mutual-fund company.But the investment in Mumbai-based UTI Asset Management Co. has been dogged by discord with the Indian partners, slackening in India's mutual-fund industry and slippage of UTI's market share. T. Rowe's woes also underscore the difficulties facing some foreign money managers in the country.Though Indian laws allow foreign companies to fully own mutual-fund companies, T. Rowe, like some other foreign rivals, entered India through a joint venture, hoping to eventually increase its ownership. The Baltimore-based company in 2010 teamed up with four government-owned financial groups, which sold T. Rowe an equal portion of their UTI equity for a total of $140 million. The deal made T. Rowe the single-largest holder in UTI, with 26%.But that didn't help when UTI's chairman and managing director, U.K. Sinha, left last February to head India's capital markets regulator.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Never mind that the Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 26% in 1987's fourth quarter, or that some broad market averages did even worse. A handful of stocks still showed spritely advances for the quarter.Leading all gainers was Citizens Insurance Co. of America Class A, a tiny over-the-counter stock that leapt 100% in the three months ended Dec. 31.Right behind it was Northview Corp., a San Diego-based financial and lodging concern that rose 77% in the fourth quarter. Things didn't look so good for Northview a year ago, when its chairman, Ivan Boesky, came under fire for his misdeeds on Wall Street. But Mr. Boesky quit his Northview job, and in the fourth quarter, new management negotiated a takeover of the company by Calmark Financial, simultaneous to a self-tender by Northview of all its stock outstanding.Such winners are a bit on the esoteric side, though. Citizens Insurance's yearly revenue amounts to just $7 million, according to Media General's databank. And Northview chose to announce its Calmark transaction the morning of Oct. 19 -- right before the Dow Jones Industrials plunged 508 points that day. Investors might have had other things on their mind.So what about the top performing stocks on major exchanges? In a quarter when the dollar kept falling and the U.S. trade deficit kept widening, it made sense that the New York Stock Exchange had to import its No. 1 stock. Leading the pack on the Big Board was Tricentrol PLC, a British oil stock that rose 40% amid takeover overtures from Elf Aquitaine of France.</TEXT>

The Bank of Japan alone dumped $800 million in Far Eastern markets, they said.Noticeably absent, however, was West Germany's Bundesbank, which neither participated in the intervention effort nor raised a key interest rate as many traders had anticipated.News that consumer prices in April rose 0.7% caused the dollar to jump up, because inflation would keep U.S. interest rates high. But when traders realized that mercurial food and energy prices made up most of the increase, the dollar quickly fell back.Dealers conceded that yesterday's intervention may have bought the central banks some time. But they warned that if they don't see continued evidence of cooperative efforts -- especially in raising interest rates abroad -- foreign-exchange traders will seek to push the U.S. currency even higher.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>U.S. wholesale prices sank further last month, a sign of how quickly the inflationary pressures of last summer have reversed.Producer prices fell a seasonally adjusted 1.9% in December from the previous month, the Labor Department said, led by lower energy prices. It marks the fifth-straight monthly decline and a stunning reversal in just a few short months from the price pressures seen in mid-2008.The lower prices bring some much-needed relief to hard-pressed businesses as the U.S. recession marches on -- but they also reflect weakness in global demand for goods. Manufacturing activity is down sharply in the world's biggest economies, including the U.S., Japan and Europe; it also has slowed in markets like China that once had enormous demand for raw materials. U.S. producer prices in December were down 0.9% from the previous year, the biggest yearly drop since 2001.Energy prices fell 9.3% last month from November, as wholesale gasoline prices tumbled 25.7%. Food prices declined 1.5%. The declines are expected to be passed on to consumers, as businesses work to attract customers through heavy discounting. The Labor Department will release its December consumer prices on Friday.Excluding food and energy, core producer prices held up last month, rising 0.2% from November and 4.3% from the previous year -- the largest annual gain in two decades. But core prices are expected to decline in the months ahead, which, combined with falling wages, is stoking concerns about a looming downward spiral of lower prices and spending known as deflation.</TEXT>

Increased buying by brokerage houses in bond futures yesterday reflected heightened public interest, analysts said.Bond price gains eroded on cash markets after the futures market closed. "It makes you wonder if the market is overheated," one futures trader said.Nevertheless, Treasury bond futures closed 1 7/32 higher at 79-29 for June delivery. "It's a market that's accelerating and it doesn't seem to need much new or good information to go higher," said James Florsheim, an analyst with Heinold Commodities Inc., Chicago. "There's euphoria" among traders holding contracts to take delivery of bonds, "and relative fear and depression from those who might want to sell," he said. Until the rally loses momentum, projecting its end is taking "potshots," he said.Crude-oil futures fell 45 cents a barrel to $27.02 for July delivery amid eroding prices on the spot, or noncontract, market and talk that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' ability to support prices is weakening. Nonfinancial commodity futures generally reflected the deflationary oil-price environment yesterday, continuing to hover near 2 1/2-year lows, according to an index compiled by the Commodity Research Bureau.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Ben LevisohnBond yields hit record lows again this week. Is it time to start positioning your portfolio for rising rates?At first blush such a move might seem like portfolio suicide. The main drivers of rising interest rates--economic growth and inflation--are nowhere in sight. In fact, Treasury yields could fall further if the Federal Reserve starts buying bonds again in a widely anticipated maneuver known as "quantitative easing."But step back from day-to-day market gyrations and a different picture emerges. Bond yields have fallen for most of the past three decades. A $1,000 investment in the U.S. government debt in 1980 would be worth about $12,970 today, according to the Ryan Labs Treasury Composite Index. Treasury prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, have surged 9.3% this year alone.Now consider a different era: 1949 through 1979. Over that 30-year span, a $1,000 initial investment in Treasurys would have turned into a far humbler $2,950. That's because yields soared during the period; by 1980 the yield on the 10-year Treasury had reached a record high of nearly 16%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Economists padded their industrial production estimates -- grudgingly in some cases -- after February's robust payroll report.The stronger job data are likely to be reflected in Friday's reports on output and capacity utilization, but analysts warn of several quirks in the employment numbers. What's more, they flag February's producer price index data as a reminder of troublesome inflation.The week also holds reports on February housing starts and permits, retail sales and auto sales, and January's business inventories. Like the job figures, many of these reports can be swayed by seasonal factors or the stop-and-go auto industry.Nonetheless, many economists were upgrading their output forecasts and thinking about raising their gross national product estimates last Friday after the job data were released."The numbers are the numbers, and that's the problem with this game," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. Mr. Kudlow concedes he's considering raising his first-quarter GNP estimate of 1.5% by as much as a full percentage point after plugging the jobs numbers -- flawed or not -- into the GNP formula.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ROSWELL, Ga. -- The waiting list for subsidized housing here, just 40 families long a year ago, is up to 500. The number of children eligible for free or reduced lunch is up 50%. A little more than a year ago, the Methodist church began seminars for marriages strained by job losses.Roswell is a pre-Civil War cotton mill town that grew into a wealthy bedroom community of Atlanta as the metro area prospered. More than half the city's 88,000 residents have four-year college degrees. But Roswell sits in a region with an unusually severe case of long-term unemployment: About 40% of the unemployed in the Atlanta metro area in 2010, the most recent local data available, were out of work for a year or more versus the national average of 29%.One of them is Marcy Bronner, 57 years old. When she lost her job at Pennzoil back in 2000, it took her seven months to find a new one at Quintiles, a bio- and pharmaceutical-services company. She eventually became senior director of human resources at a salary in the low six figures.In November 2010, she was laid off again. More than a year later, she is still looking for work. "It's harder now," she says, compared to the 2000s. "There's a lot more people out there."While the job market is improving -- the national unemployment rate fell to 8.5% in December -- long-term unemployment continues to be particularly pronounced, and there is little indication that it is falling quickly. The government said that in December 3.9 million nationwide had been out of work for at least a year and were still looking. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has called this "a national crisis."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>JACKSON HOLE, Wyo.--Ben Bernanke encountered a heavy dose of skepticism and doubt here this weekend.In a highly anticipated speech on monetary policy Friday, the Federal Reserve chairman argued that the Fed's easy-money policies were helping the weak economy and laid the groundwork for more action.But economists and central bankers wondered more openly than usual if the Fed had the tools to fix the problems of the day and expressed frustration that four years of super low interest rates and extraordinary money-pumping by the Fed hadn't done more to spur the slow-moving economy."Why is it that we've had such incredibly accommodative monetary policy for so long and we've had so little growth?" Donald Kohn, a Brookings Institution scholar, asked from the audience after a panel discussion here Saturday.It was a striking question because Mr. Kohn is a former vice chairman of the Fed and was Mr. Bernanke's right-hand man during the financial crisis. The headwinds that the Fed often cites--Europe, household debt-reduction, the housing bust--he said were unsatisfying answers. "There is a lot we don't understand," he said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Federal Reserve, forced by Congress to release details on trillions of dollars' worth of loans made during the financial crisis, disclosed the breadth of its lending to U.S. businesses desperate to raise cash and the surprising degree to which it supported struggling foreign banks in the worst days of 2008 and 2009.The lending, most of which has been paid back, represents the Fed's most aggressive intervention in the economy ever, and included loans to stalwart industrial companies such as General Electric Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. Though the Fed has been credited with helping prevent many banks and firms from collapsing as credit markets stopped functioning, critics also say the Fed overreached and the latest disclosures could open new fault lines.The scale of the Fed's lending was widely known. In all it funneled $3.3 trillion worth of credit to different parts of the economy and financial system through an array of different programs during the crisis. But the specifics of who got the money hadn't been known.Foreign banks received hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term loans from the Fed. Among the biggest loans from a Fed commercial-paper lending program was one to Swiss banking giant UBS AG, which tapped it for $37 billion in October 2008. Barclays PLC, the British bank that declined to rescue Lehman Brothers but later bought much of it from bankruptcy, tapped the Fed for roughly $10 billion in commercial-paper loans in October 2008.All the borrowings were repaid by the end of 2009, a Barclays spokesman said. A UBS representative said its borrowing was relatively modest, done to give it flexibility during the crisis and was fully repaid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If Japan is worried by the sudden outbreak of protectionist bombast in Washington, welcome to the club. We too have been more than a little shaken by the King Kong roars from the House and Senate chambers this past week. They threaten to touch off jungle emotions no one could control. And nothing would halt the U.S. economic recovery or send U.S. living standards tumbling faster than a trade war with Japan.The most serious warning signal came Tuesday when a resolution was whooped through Sen. Packwood's Finance Committee demanding U.S. retaliation with tariffs and quotas unless the Japanese compensate Americans for sales lost because of "unfair trade practices." Sen. Dole wisely pigeonholed this document to give legislators a chance to cool off on their Easter holidays, but there is no guarantee they will return with any greater wisdom than when they left.As we have said here before, Japan is not blameless for this outburst of jingoism. Prime Minister Nakasone should have been more forthcoming when the U.S. asked for a fairer shot at the Japanese market for telecommunications equipment. The Japanese finally made concessions but Mr. Nakasone still is insisting that a Japanese committee should "approve" imported equipment, at least for the next year. That has a protectionist smell.It's inconceivable why Japan plays games like this. With its huge stake in international trade, it should strive to make itself one of the world's least protectionist nations. Its tariffs are lower than those of the U.S., but its non-tariff barriers are the rub. Mr. Nakasone has promised new "market opening" measures this month, but it will come as a big surprise if they are impressive improvements.The U.S. would be even more foolish, however, if it took steps to limit its trade with Japan. As George Gilder observed so astutely on this page last week, U.S.-Japanese trade is synergistic. Both sides benefit enormously, despite the U.S. "deficit" American mercantilists are always harping about. High-quality Japanese components are vital to high-tech U.S. products. Japanese competition keeps U.S. manufacturers on their toes. Most important, inexpensive Japanese goods help Americans raise their living standards, reducing wage demands on U.S. manufacturers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- A plunge in stock prices helped lift Treasurys prices moderately. But traders said bond-market activity was muted as many people pared back trading positions well ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday in the U.S.Late yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 face value, at 100 16/32. Its yield fell to 5.664% from 5.694% late Friday, as yields move inversely to prices.Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 9/32 at 106 28/32 to yield 5.752%, down from 5.773% Friday.There weren't any major economic indicators during the session, and that left the bond market to focus primarily on the weakness in stocks. The Nasdaq Composition Index plummeted 151.44 points to 2875.75, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 167.22 points to 10462.65.When stock prices fall sharply, investors often move funds to the relative safety of government securities. Some of the gains yesterday in Treasurys reflected such shifts, although a portion of the market's movement stemmed only from anticipation that investors would move to bonds from stocks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>THE FINANCIAL markets could use a few good inflation watchers these days as soaring oil prices and a strong economy stoke concerns about rising consumer prices.Among economists regularly surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, two have stood out for their ability to forecast inflation: Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, and Maria Fiorini Ramirez, of MFR Inc. Unfortunately, for those in need of guidance, the two economists now see things very differently. Ms. Fosler expects inflation to pick up by year's end while Ms. Ramirez sees inflation easing off a bit.Collectively, the 56 economists in the Journal surveys have been expecting headline inflation to move down from the 3% rate posted early in the year, as prices for energy and other commodities ease. The consensus of the economists who participated in the latest monthly survey is that the consumer-price index will rise 2.5% on an annual basis by year's end. But that consensus is creeping up. The group was looking for a CPI increase of 2.3% two months ago.Getting a fix on inflation and oil is becoming increasingly important. Higher consumer inflation could push up interest rates and erode the purchasing power of households, which could eventually derail economic growth. Right now the economy is sending off mixed signals on the outlook. While commodity prices have soared, manufacturers have had difficulty passing higher costs on to consumers.Forecasts reflect the confusion. Among economists who have participated in the survey for at least three years, only nine accurately predicted the inflation rate would slow in 2003, when it dipped below 2%, and then accelerate again in 2004, when it shot up over 3%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Three American economists won the Nobel Prize for work that centers on how mechanisms such as markets and auctions can get people to admit how much something is worth to them.Americans Leonid Hurwicz, Eric S. Maskin and Roger B. Myerson were awarded the Nobel prize in economics Monday for their study of "mechanism design." An abstract branch of economics that employs daunting formulas and heroic feats of mathematics, mechanism design is decidedly clear-eyed in its approach understanding always-less-than- perfect circumstances of economic exchanges. One way to understand the "mechanisms" these distinguished dismal scientists study is to think about an auction for, say, a Picasso painting. It's a pretty efficient way of getting people to admit -- by bidding -- how much they value the painting. And according to Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University and well-known economics blogger, essentially, these economists use math to analyze and describe that process of "trying to get people to tell the truth or reveal information." Jeffrey Ely, an economics professor at Northwestern University who works in the field, explains mechanism design as a sort of reverse engineering of game theory, a field in which people try to understand how individual incentives and structural rules interact and result in certain behaviors. But instead of just understanding the rules of existing systems, mechanism design focuses on designing them in such as way that a certain outcome is achieved. "They developed the basic tools for thinking about institutions in this way," Mr. Ely said of today's award winners.Alvin Roth is a professor of economics at Harvard University who has used some of the theories pioneered by today's Nobel award winners to help design programs such as the process by which medical students are placed in residency programs at hospitals. "You might say that before modern game theory, economists looked at markets and other economic institutions sort of the way botanists look at plants, as naturally occurring mysteries to be studied," Mr. Roth wrote in an email. "Mechanism design takes seriously that markets are built by people, and starts to ask what we can do with them, what we can't, and how best to go about it." As such, their work has applications in a wide range of fields, from regulatory policies such as the Federal Communications Commission's somewhat abstract auctions of bandwidth on the wireless spectrum, to the residency-placement system devised Mr. Roth, to the kidney-donation swaps highlighted in today's Wall Street Journal. And, more generally, the economists' theories can be used as a framework to help identify when markets, auctions or other mechanisms -- such as matching programs -- might be better -- or ill -- suited for providing a specific outcome.At 90 years old, Mr. Hurwicz is the oldest Nobel winner ever, according to the academy. Mr. Maskin, 56 years old, is professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, N.J.; and Mr. Myerson, 56, is a professor at the University of Chicago. The award is officially known as the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. It isn't one of the original Nobel Prizes, but was created in 1968 by the Swedish central bank in Alfred Nobel's memory. Nobel Prize winners receive $1.5 million, a gold medal and a diploma from the Swedish king on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.---</TEXT>

    <TEXT>AT A TIME WHEN China commands more attention from investors than any other emerging market, many U.S. fund managers are starting to take a closer look at the other billion-person nation: India.India has received only a fraction of the money that corporations have invested in China, but portfolio managers say India is in a number of ways the more attractive stock-market investment.The South Asian giant has spawned a greater number of companies that can compete on a global scale and whose management style more closely resembles their U.S. competitors. That list includes Indian software firms such as Infosys Technologies and Wipro and pharmaceutical companies such as Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, all of which trade in New York. Investors also credit India with having better corporate disclosure, stronger property rights, and a more investor-friendly legal system than China.India is about a dozen years behind China in liberalizing its economy, lowering tariffs, and opening up industry to foreign investors. But it is beginning to close that gap. Just recently, in fact, the government raised the ceiling on foreign investment in private banks and abolished foreign limits on private oil exploration and marketing companies.New Delhi is forecasting Indian economic growth of about 8% for the fiscal year ending next month -- on par with China's official growth forecast for 2004 -- and it has emerged as the world leader for outsourcing and call centers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The robust economy has postponed the day of reckoning for Social Security's solvency by three years, until 2032, according to new estimates from the program's trustees.And, at least in the near term, last year's balanced-budget law has greatly improved the outlook for Medicare, the federal health program for 38 million elderly and disabled people. It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by $115 billion in the next five years.The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the "strength in the U.S. economy" has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2% of taxable payroll.The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers: They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2% a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The first significant sign that the economy is cooling emerged when the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate rose for the first time in more than a year.The unemployment rate for January jumped 0.3 percentage point to 5.7%, matching October's level. The Labor Department also reported that employers created only 134,000 jobs last month, about half the pace of previous months and the smallest gain in a year.While economists were careful to note that the new data suggest the economy is still growing, many agreed the report seems to indicate the year-long series of interest-rate rises engineered by the Federal Reserve finally have kicked in."It takes about 12 months for the rate hikes to have an effect," said Edward Yardeni, an economist at C.J. Lawrence. "This is the year we'll see it happen."The financial markets rallied on the news as investors speculated that interest rates may soon stop rising. Bond prices rose; the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to 7.62% from 7.74%. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 57.87 to 3928.64.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The recession knocked Procter & Gamble's stock out cold. Have the smelling salts finally arrived?Shares of the world's largest consumer-products company have gained just 2% since the start of 2009, compared with a 22% rise for rival Colgate-Palmolive. The latter relies less on high-end products that consumers have forgone and has a stronger emerging-markets position. Since long before the economic crisis unfolded, Colgate's shares have traded at a premium price/earnings multiple.Procter should have a healthier glow when both companies report quarterly earnings Thursday. Price reductions appear to have helped Procter win back market share in recent months, which should have underpinned strong sales. But those price cuts have been limited to about 10% of the company's portfolio and could damage Procter's margins and brands if extended much further.The bigger question for Procter is whether consumers in the U.S. and Western Europe are ready to trade back up to its premium products. A survey of both high and low-income groups shows consumers have become willing to spend more on consumer products in the last two months, according to Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research. That could drive an impressive sales recovery, but only if developed economies stay on course and labor markets improve steadily.Colgate's prospects look more dependable. Unlike Procter, which is saddled with low-growth products such as diapers and toilet paper, Colgate has a smaller portfolio generating faster sales increases.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Dave KansasThe stock market has had a heady few weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has mustered above 11000 for the first time since April -- and it has managed to stay there through the early part of the third-quarter earnings season.But the swift rise of the market -- the Dow is up about 10% from its Aug. 31 close -- comes against a backdrop of somewhat unsettling news. The jobless rate remains stuck just below 10% with little respite in sight. The housing market is still very weak, and is enduring further shocks as lenders' foreclosure problems keep getting worse. The political situation seems a bit chaotic. And the global recovery is uneven enough that the Federal Reserve is thinking of yet more extraordinary measures to get things rolling.Even with those headwinds, the mood among stock investors as we near the end of October is surprisingly upbeat. Third-quarter earnings are coming in better than expected and optimism about the Fed's latest extraordinary plan -- quantitative easing part two, or QE2 -- is rampant in the stock market. We entered the dreaded September-October period in fear; we are leaving it with bliss breaking out.Such sudden shifts in sentiment, especially with uncertainty on the rise, makes me a little queasy. Given the widespread gains, it might make sense to examine your portfolio now with an eye toward rebalancing, rather than wait for the end of the year. In so doing, you may want to pare back some of the bigger winners and salt away the gains for the coming year.</TEXT>

Two of the company's newest board members resigned over the "ongoing serial disclosures of wrongdoing" at Adelphia.The news comes as Adelphia moves closer to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, something many analysts expect to happen by the end of next week, given Adelphia's cash constraints and a looming $50 million interest payment it must make by Saturday.Adelphia has begun discussions with banks about potential bankruptcy financing of as much as $1 billion or more, which would allow the company to continue operating under bankruptcy protection, according to people familiar with the matter.In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Adelphia provided some results from its own internal review launched several weeks ago after it was disclosed that the founding Rigas family had benefited from more than $3 billion in loans from the company.In its filing, Adelphia blamed former management, which included the Rigas family. The company said that current management believes information provided by prior management, including the amount of the company's cable system that has been rebuilt, "was unreliable" and said Adelphia plans to "correct the information, where material, as current management develops information it considers reliable."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SINGAPORE -- Singapore's reputation as a haven for those seeking solid, if not spectacular, gains took a hit in the first quarter, as the market's main index fell more sharply than all others in Southeast Asia.But that doesn't mean investors should shift to higher-risk, potentially higher-return Asian markets, fund managers and analysts say. Instead, they say, investors need to study what has changed in Singapore companies while maintaining a long-term view. Those with a distant horizon and stock-picking acumen have found Singapore a good investment, they say.Singapore's Straits Times Index was closed yesterday for a holiday, as other major markets in Asia finished higher. Continental European markets were generally higher, while London was closed for a holiday. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.01 point, or 0.01%, to 199.28. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 0.58 point, or 0.40%, to 146.77.The first quarter proved that during global selloffs, the redundant phrase "safe haven" doesn't exist for stocks. "The only safe haven is cash -- or utilities in Hong Kong," says Sean Darby, regional strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.And some analysts and strategists aren't sure all the bad news has come out.

The alliance marks the first time one of the new alternative trading systems, known as ECNs, will effectively share a membership card as a traditional stock exchange.By joining with the Pacific, Archipelago would instantly acquire the status necessary to compete with the NYSE on a level playing field.Under the alliance, Archipelago Holdings LLC, which operates the Archipelago electronic communications network, will acquire the Pacific Exchange's struggling stock-trading business. In return, the Pacific Exchange, based in San Francisco, will become a minority shareholder in Archipelago and provide regulatory and exchange-management services to the new entity.The plan is subject to regulatory approvals. Archipelago is one of the fast-growing screen-based trading systems that have grabbed almost a third of the Nasdaq Stock Market's volume. They have taken very little share of NYSE-listed volume, however, partly because they are technically brokers, and only stock exchanges have full access to the linkages between the venues that trade NYSE stocks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK -- Rates of long-term fixed-rate home mortgages rose this week, according to the primary market survey by Freddie Mac, the housing-finance agency.Freddie Mac attributed the rise in mortgage rates to improved sentiment in financial markets that growth in the final quarter of 2004 will be strong. "Of course, with the signs of strong growth come fears of inflation, and that tends to push up long-term mortgage rates," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac chief economist, in a statement.The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate rose to 5.81% from 5.72% in the week. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 5.89%.The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage rate rose to 5.23% from 5.15%. A year ago, this rate stood at 5.22%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>China's move to take a $3 billion stake in U.S. private-equity giant Blackstone Group marks an unusually aggressive start to the country's long-anticipated campaign to diversify how it invests its massive $1.2 trillion foreign-exchange reserves. The deal is expected to be completed alongside Blackstone's announced $4 billion initial public offering of a 10% stake in the firm.News of China's planned Blackstone stake comes as U.S.-China economic talks are about to begin in Washington, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi. The run-up to the talks has been dominated by U.S. complaints about China's currency, which many Washington politicians say is kept artificially low to give Chinese exports an unfair advantage.Chinese leaders have repeatedly said they want to reduce the country's trade imbalance with the rest of the world, which contributes to inflationary pressures at home as well as to trade frictions abroad. As Kate Linebaugh and Andrew Batson report, an investment in Blackstone would be one way for China to show it is willing to increase its flow of dollars to the U.S. to try to balance the flood of dollars into China.Meanwhile, a rare change to China's currency regime unveiled Friday ahead of this week's Washington talks has done little to appease the country's critics abroad, but new financial tightening measures, including an interest-rate increase, could help with another of Beijing's priorities: calming the frenzy in its stock market.---</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Technology issues fell again and consumer names retreated as investors interpreted the Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates again as a signal that economic trends remain weak.A host of telecommunications-gear makers fell during trading. Communications-chip maker Broadcom shed $4.73, or 13%, to $33.06 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Optical-equipment maker JDS Uniphase, which hit a 52-week low Monday, fell further, dropping 44 cents, or 5.9%, to 7.07. Cellphone-chip maker RF Micro Devices slid 2.02, or 7.9%, to 23.54. Storage-software developer Brocade Communications retreated 1.60, or 5.9%, to 25.47. All trade on Nasdaq.The weakness came after the Federal Reserve voted to lower interest rates to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the central bank's seventh rate cut this year.Market averages, which had moved slightly higher, albeit in thin trading, ahead of the release of the Fed's decision, veered lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 50.05, or 2.7%, at 1831.30, the lowest the index has finished since April 9. Technical analyst Peter Green of Gerard Klauer Mattison speculated the Nasdaq composite could fall another 4% during the short term, given the recent technical patterns.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 145.93 points, a 1.4% drop, at 10174.14, its lowest finish since April 12.</TEXT>

The vote against the plan was nonbinding. The plan would make Mr. Schorsch one of the most highly paid REIT executives, if the company hits certain performance objectives.Under the terms of the health-care deal, shareholders of New York-based ARC Healthcare will have the option to receive 0.1688 Ventas shares for each of their shares in ARC. The deal values the ARC shares at $11.33 each, a 14% premium to their $9.95 close on Friday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The interest rate-sensitive housing sector showed mediocre gains in housing starts last month and is expected to weaken in the coming months as interest rates rise, economists said.Housing starts rose 2.4% in July to an annual rate of 1,489,000 units, the Commerce Department said. Starts of single-family units fell slightly, while starts of multifamily units rose for the first time in three months. The department also revised its June report to show an overall increase of 4.4%. The rise previously was reported at 5.1%."That's likely to be the highest increase for the rest of the year as higher interest rates are going to have a much more serious impact on the industry," said Bob Sheehan, economist at the National Apartment Association.Single-family units starts in July decreased by 0.8% to an annual rate of 1,089,000 units. In June, this sector saw an increase of 8.5%. In May, the rate declined 8.1%. Single-family construction starts in July were 5.4% below the July 1987 pace.Economists remain pessimistic about the outlook for single-family housing starts, as this sector is usually more sensitive to interest rates than multifamily housing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For America's 44 million senior citizens, plus tens of millions of others who are on the threshold of retirement, last month marked a watershed moment that is worth celebrating. At the end of October, the Federal Reserve announced the first step in returning to a more normal monetary policy. After nearly six years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, the Fed is ending its bond-buying program and has signaled a plan to eventually begin raising the federal-funds rate, raising interest rates to more normal levels by 2017.U.S. households lost billions in interest income during the Fed's near-zero interest rate experiment. Because they are often reliant on income from savings, seniors were hit the hardest. Households headed by seniors 65-74 years old lost on average $1,900 in annual income over the past six years, according to a November 2013 McKinsey Global Institute report. For households headed by seniors 75 and older, the loss was $2,700 annually.With a median income for senior households in the U.S. of roughly $25,000, these are significant losses. In total, according to my company's calculations, approximately $58 billion in annual income has been lost by America's seniors since 2008.Retirees depend on income from their savings for basic living expenses. Without that income, many seniors have taken on greater risk to increase the potential yield on their savings, or simply spent down their nest eggs. After decades of playing by the rules, putting off spending and socking away money, seniors have taken it on the chin. This strikes a blow at the core American principles of self-reliance, individual responsibility and fairness.Their lost income affects all Americans. Seniors make up 13% of the U.S. population and spend about $1.2 trillion annually -- a big chunk of America's $11.5 trillion consumer economy. In general, seniors spend more than their income, withdrawing each year from accumulated savings, and so their interest earnings get spent right back into the economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The dollar ended global trading yesterday higher against most major currencies as traders nervously tested central bankers' threshold of pain.The dollar rallied to an intraday high of 1.6932 marks and 1.4522 Swiss francs, levels unseen since April 1994 when the U.S. currency traded at 1.6935 marks and at 1.4525 Swiss francs, as traders sought to discern just how high central banks would be comfortable with the dollar trading.After being knocked off a 34-month high against the mark when the Bundesbank denied that it wants the dollar to move higher, the U.S. currency later claimed a 34-month high against the Swiss franc when the Swiss government said it considers a weak Swiss franc as one way to help cure "untenable" unemployment.The dollar gave up one yen and two pfennigs when the Bundesbank sharply denied a news service report Tuesday citing unnamed sources as saying the central bank would welcome a dollar advance to 1.7000-1.7100 marks over time."There is definitely no such opinion on the wish for a higher dollar," a Bundesbank spokesman said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Money-market mutual funds have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity this year. Their assets may never return to the record levels reached in the fall of 1982, shortly before banks were allowed to offer competing "money market accounts." But the floundering stock market, the rise in interest rates and a rate advantage over the bank competitors have led consumers to increase their holdings of these easy-access, market-rate investments.Investors shouldn't assume that the more than 300 money funds are all alike. The funds can differ in such things as their minimums for investment and check-writing and the ease of getting through to customer-service people on the telephone. Perhaps more important, they also vary widely in the types of short-term assets they buy. These differences produce varying yields and levels of risk."Money funds are looked at as a homogeneous, commodity-type product. But when you look at them closely, you see there are really big differences in risk and management policy," says Edward A. Taber III, money-fund portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.Consumers haven't had to become aware of the risk differences because the money funds have an excellent safety record. No fund has ever owned a security that defaulted. Investors suffered a 6% decline in principal in one small fund several years ago, but that was because the fund had extended the maturity of its holdings to the point that many would say it wasn't even a money fund anymore. Nevertheless, there conceivably could be principal losses in a money fund, so investors should be aware of how much risk their particular fund is taking.The most common type of money fund is one that invests in a diversified portfolio of short-term government securities, bank certificates of deposit and corporate obligations called "commercial paper." Other funds stick to the safety of government obligations. There also are big distinctions within each category. Yields generally rise with the risk of the investments, as shown in the accompanying data from Donoghue's Money Fund Report.</TEXT>

The Dow average logged its first weekly loss since the week ended Aug. 30, declining 1.25%, and it has fallen in six of the past seven trading days. For the year to date, the 30-stock gauge is up more than 16%.The prospect of a partial government shutdown next week as Congress and the White House wrangle over the budget helped keep buyers at bay, overshadowing encouraging economic data and corporate reports, including strong results from Nike, a new addition to the Dow average."The market is very narrowly focused on what's going on in Washington," said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at ING U.S. Investment Management.Mr. Zemsky said what is worrisome isn't so much that the government might shut down in the coming week, but the apparent political dysfunction shows how difficult it will be to raise the debt ceiling in a couple of weeks.

    <TEXT>THE DOUBTERS are stepping aside, at least until next year, and the bulls are beginning to wonder how high they can push the stock market before year's end.After almost a month of soft performance, when some investors worried that the market had already peaked for the year, stocks resumed their rampage this past week, on the back of reassuring economic and profit data.With the November consumer-price inflation numbers coming in virtually flat Friday -- a welcome surprise -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed to a second consecutive record finish, its 20th record since October began. For the week, the Dow was up 138.03 points, or 1.1%, at 12445.52, including a gain of 28.76 points Friday. The Dow has risen 16.1% in 2006, with almost all that gain coming in a sharp climb since July 14.The mood of the market was a tad euphoric, making some skeptics warn again that stocks have gotten ahead of themselves and are overdue for a pullback."Equities are overbought," said Bijal Shah, senior stock strategist for Societe Generale's Corporate & Investment Banking division, in a report entitled, "2007: A Correction or a Bear Market?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With short-term interest rates remaining locked near zero, yield-starved investors have been turning to "ultrashort" bond funds as a safe place to stash their cash. Attracted by yields on ultrashort funds ranging mostly between 0.2% and 1.3%, investors shifted $9.6 billion into the group during the first seven months of 2013, according to Morningstar Inc.Fund companies, meanwhile, have been rolling out new offerings, including ultrashort exchange-traded bond funds.These funds, which invest in bonds typically maturing in less than one year, are likely to suffer smaller losses than other bond funds when interest rates rise. Yet investors need to remember that they can lose money; they're not a money-market substitute. And within the group there's a range of strategies carrying different risks.Some investors with a long memory may recently have gotten a reminder of how ultrashort bond funds can fail to protect investor money: Last month, Charles Schwab Corp.'s fund unit filed with regulators to offer a series of ultrashort ETFs. The Schwab YieldPlus mutual fund lost 35% during the financial crisis in 2008, resulting in the company agreeing to pay a $119 million fine to settle civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had allegedly misled investors about the safety of the fund. (Schwab didn't admit or deny guilt.)It's unclear from the new filings how the ETFs will differ from the YieldPlus strategy. A Schwab spokeswoman says the strategies are different from "other Schwab funds and ETFs currently or previously offered." But she declines to comment further, citing the "quiet period" around the fund filings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve policy makers raised interest rates last month in part because markets expected them to do so, and they figured failure to act might hurt their credibility as inflation fighters, minutes of the meeting suggest.The minutes were released on the second of two days of congressional testimony on monetary policy by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Mr. Bernanke repeated his main themes of the previous day: Inflation is at a troubling level but should decline as the economy slows and energy prices stabilize.Yesterday, markets lowered to 47%, from 62% Wednesday, the odds the Fed would raise short-term interest rates, now at 5.25%, to 5.5% at its next meeting Aug. 8.Policy makers boosted their target for short-term rates in June because of a "deterioration in the inflation outlook," the minutes say. But they also acted to "preserve the decline in inflation expectations" of preceding weeks, which "appeared to be conditioned" on expectations of higher rates.Fed officials typically attribute rate actions to economic and inflation developments, not to market expectations. The disclosure in the minutes, released after the customary three-week delay, suggests that based on their economic forecast alone, the decision to raise rates would have been a closer call.</TEXT>

Today, public sentiment toward the men and women in uniform has widely shifted, as many locals are up in arms over escalating pension costs for public-safety workers.In the current fiscal year ending June 30, San Jose's retirement obligations soared to $245 million, up from $73 million a decade ago, according to the city. For police officers and firefighters who have retired since 2007, the average pension is $95,336, making them among the most generously compensated in the state.Since the recession, dozens of state legislatures and city councils across the U.S. have scaled back benefits and jobs in an attempt to plug gaping budget holes. Safety workers like police and firefighters -- who generally earn more than librarians and garbage haulers -- have often been spared from some of the most drastic cuts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University's secretive seven-member governing board issued an unusual statement yesterday: It stands behind the school's president, Lawrence H. Summers.The board's one-page letter to "the Harvard community" sets the stage for a possible showdown between Mr. Summers and his prominent faculty critics, who are moving toward a referendum on his leadership.The immediate source of friction between Mr. Summers and the faculty was a talk he gave at a recent conference on work-force diversification -- statements that he finally made public yesterday -- but the roots of the clash run deeper.Hired more than three years ago to retool Harvard for the 21st century, the former Treasury secretary has found the hierarchical management style common in corporations and cabinet agencies to be a tough fit for a storied university accustomed to decision making that is decentralized and collegial. The confrontation comes as more and more universities, pressed financially on several fronts, have turned to leaders with experience outside academia to reinvigorate their institutions -- and have in turn often met resistance from faculty.The campus firestorm over Mr. Summers erupted last month when he made comments at a National Bureau of Economic Research conference here suggesting that innate gender differences could help explain why fewer women gain high-level academic careers in science and math. Prominent Harvard faculty and presidents of other elite universities spoke out publicly against his views.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Law-firm billing practices that have come under close scrutiny in recent years are getting additional attention at the criminal-fraud trial of attorney Harvey M. Myerson.Mr. Myerson is defending himself against charges of overbilling clients by $2.5 million and defrauding partners of about $1 million when he ran the now-defunct New York law firm Myerson & Kuhn. During the trial, Mr. Myerson has argued that the overbilling was done by younger partners without his knowledge and that the $1 million in expenses he charged to the firm was an advance he intended to pay back.Few people suggest that the widespread fraud Mr. Myerson is accused of organizing is common practice at the nation's law firms, but some of the testimony in this colorful trial in the Brooklyn, N.Y., federal courthouse is highlighting the potential pitfalls and ethical dilemmas that lawyers may face when billing a client.Witnesses describing billing practices at Myerson & Kuhn have mentioned "using a heavy pen," which means rounding up to the next time unit in measuring fractions of hours worked on a client matter. The witnesses have also referred to "the smell test," a crude way lawyers can tell whether a weighty bill won't seem exorbitant to a client. Lawyers said in interviews that such phrases are not unheard of at other firms, although the lawyers point out that the legal recession, probably more than the threat of criminal action, is making firms more precise about their bills.Government witnesses have also testified about adding "late time," or additional hours they didn't actually work, to bills. It was a client's analysis of such bills that eventually led to the criminal investigation of Myerson & Kuhn.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Despite nervousness about falling stock prices, the nation's corporate purchasing managers expect stronger economic growth in 1988 and only a mild increase in inflation.Purchasing managers surveyed in mid-November by the National Association of Purchasing Management were "extremely optimistic" about the 1988 outlook, said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee. This optimism, he said, is fueled by "significant increases in export business."The purchasing managers sounded more optimistic than most economists in several recent surveys. Many economists fear the stock market's collapse on Oct. 19 will make shoppers more cautious, especially on such major purchases as autos and homes. Some also fear the stock market's woes may persuade companies to postpone capital spending plans until a clearer picture of the economy's health emerges. Nevertheless, most economists still contend there is no evidence of a recession coming anytime soon.The consensus in the association's semiannual survey is that this year's fourth quarter will be better than the third. Also, next year's first half is expected to be even stronger than this year's second half.The economy's pace is expected to slow in the second half of 1988. Price increases next year will average about 3.6%, up from an estimated 3.2% this year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Junk-bond issuers may have found the limit of investors' goodwill.After easily finding buyers for a flood of new debt sales to fund leveraged buyouts or dividend payments, private-equity firms and other junk issuers found the going tougher this past week.Golf-course operator ClubCorp. on Friday delayed its expected $415 million offering until this coming week. Manufacturer Nortek Inc. on Thursday shrank its offering to $250 million from $300 million and agreed to a higher interest rate. Burlington Coat Factory postponed a sale that would have handed Bain Capital a $325 million dividend. And in the stock market, TPG and Apollo Management canceled an initial public offering by Harrah's Entertainment on Thursday after investors balked at the terms, a sign that stock investors are also being picky.While this past week may well be a blip, the struggles of some deals do show how investors are becoming more demanding.

    <TEXT>The expanding army of homeless, the increasing filth of our streets, tightening educational and police protection budgets, and the snowballing real price of medical care, higher education, performing arts, legal services and insurance are all inescapable realities of life. Every industrial country suffers from these symptoms to some degree, but, as in other fields, they are still a few years behind us.What has gone wrong and what, if anything, can be done? While no single cause can account for these complex problems, one influence explains a good deal, and suggests the way out.Productivity stagnation in the service industries has led to persistent rises in their costs. The laggard services include, most notably, health care, education, legal services, welfare programs for the poor, postal service, police protection, sanitation, repair services, the performing arts and restaurants. Their common element is the handicraft character of their production, requiring large labor inputs that are resistant to curtailment.There are at least two reasons why rapid and persistent productivity growth has eluded these stagnant services. First, some of them are inherently hard to standardize. Before one can cure a patient or repair a broken piece of machinery, it is necessary to determine, case by case, just what is wrong, and the treatment must then be tailored to the individual case.A second reason why it has been difficult to reduce the labor content of these services is that in many of them quality is, or is believed to be, inescapably correlated with the amount of labor expended on them. Teachers who cut down the time they spend on their classes or who increase class size, doctors who speed up the examination of patients, or a police force that spends less time on the beat, are all held to be shortchanging those whom they serve.</TEXT>

That was more than double the 1.7% rate of the previous quarter, and a good indication that the underlying potential of the economy remains strong.In the 12 months through September, nonfarm productivity grew 5.3%, its fastest rate in 19 years. Economists have attributed the gains to increased efficiencies from computers and the Internet, as well as the fact that employees that remain after a wave of layoffs tend to be more skilled. Although labor costs are rising, output is rising more than enough to compensate.Such strong productivity doesn't necessarily change the short-term economic outlook, which remains somewhat gloomy. But it does suggest that corporate profits will continue to improve and that inflation will remain in check -- both of which are important if the economy is to get back on track.When a company boosts productivity, it can squeeze more output from its existing workers without drastically increasing costs. At the same time, it helps keep a lid on inflation, as companies grow without incurring new expenses that they would otherwise pass on to customers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>JACKSON HOLE, Wyo.--Janet Yellen delivered a cliffhanger in the mountains of Wyoming.Encouraged by progress in the U.S. labor market, but uncertain if it is enough, the Federal Reserve Board chairwoman and other officials who gathered here for a central-bank conference left the public guessing about when they will start raising short-term interest rates.The annual economic symposium, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, marked an important bookend to a speech Ms. Yellen had delivered five months earlier to a conference of community organizers in Chicago.Back then, Ms. Yellen argued with conviction that the U.S. economy was still far from what Fed officials call full employment--the highest level of hiring that can be reached without causing the economy to overheat and spark inflation.The jobless rate was 6.7%, while 3.8 million Americans were out of work for six months or longer and 7.2 million more had part-time work but wanted full-time jobs. Wages were creeping up at a glacial pace. Ms. Yellen saw this as evidence that the economy was burdened with slack, which would allow her to keep short-term interest rates low far into the future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FOR THE STOCK MARKET, a big Washington scandal usually is little more than a tempest in a Teapot Dome.From President Harding's Teapot Dome scandal -- named for a Wyoming rock formation atop a misused government oil reserve -- through the Clinton impeachment, stocks have proved remarkably impervious to news that has roiled the political world.It happened again last week. Thursday's stock tumble was influenced by reports that White House aide I. Lewis Libby was about to be indicted. But stocks quickly rebounded Friday even before the indictment was announced. Down 115 points on Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 172.82 points on Friday to 10402.77, up 187.55 points, or 1.8%, on the week.Some of Friday's advance, certainly, reflected investor relief that the waiting was over and that Karl Rove, president Bush's political guru, wasn't indicted. But the investigation of White House leaks continues and Mr. Rove remains in legal jeopardy. When the indictment was announced during the day, the market fell, but just for a few minutes, before resuming its rise. Traders said Friday's gains appeared to have less to do with politics than with economics. They reflected pleasure that the government's report on third-quarter economic performance, also out Friday, included low inflation figures and good growth numbers.And that is the way it usually goes with political scandals. Corporate profits, inflation and interest rates are what drive stock prices. Unless political news affects those things, by making a tax increase or an economic slowdown more likely, its impact on markets tends to be short-lived.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For oil prices, subject to such vagaries as Nigerian politics and Atlantic winds, rules of thumb are alluring.One currently in vogue is that oil, priced in dollars, rises as the greenback falls. Working the other way, expensive oil widens the U.S. trade deficit, undermining the dollar.Both arguments offer only a partial explanation. Oil has roughly doubled since February as the dollar fell 15% against the euro. But oil also roughly doubled in 2004 and 2005 while the dollar held steady.Similarly, the U.S. trade deficit is subject to factors other than oil. For example, it ballooned in the late 1980s, even as oil prices sank. Meanwhile, Marc Chandler, author of "Making Sense of the Dollar," questions how much trade deficits really drive the dollar anyway. While increasing U.S. exports coincided with a weakening dollar earlier this decade, exports were likewise on a roll in the late 1990s, when the greenback was also strong.Changing correlations between the dollar and different assets suggest cyclical factors rule. The late 1990s and the middle part of this decade both saw strong U.S. economic growth and high or rising interest rates. Those contexts supported the buck, regardless of what oil was doing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON--A comprehensive review of major banks' foreclosure files could have delivered an additional $1.5 billion in cash to consumers if it wasn't halted last year, a federal watchdog has found.The Government Accountability Office, in a report being released Tuesday, evaluated federal bank regulators' decision last year to cancel a prolonged review of foreclosure-processing and loan-assistance mistakes. A draft of the GAO report was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The foreclosure probe has been controversial from its start three years ago. Many lawmakers said regulators should not have allowed banks to hire consulting firms who had done previous work for them. Some Democratic lawmakers also have been skeptical of regulators' decision to reach a settlement ending the review early last year, saying it was premature.The GAO report shows that the settlement "was reached without adequate investigation into the harms committed by the servicers," Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) said in a prepared statement. "Many of the files did not contain complete data, making it impossible to know whether borrowers were disqualified from the possibility of the greatest cash payouts."The foreclosure review could have provided up to $5.4 billion in cash to consumers, instead of the $3.9 billion ultimately agreed upon, the GAO report found.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MEXICO CITY -- Mexico may be starting to suffer from too much of a good thing. That has authorities worried.Good news since the year's start -- including the surging price of oil, falling inflation and the decision by Moody's Investors Service Inc. this month to elevate the country to investment grade -- has strengthened the peso by more than 4%, reignited domestic demand and caused a deterioration in the trade balance.All of this makes Mexico vulnerable to a sharp economic correction if the price of oil, Mexico's single largest export, falls more than expected, or if the economy of the U.S. -- the country's largest trading partner -- slows precipitously."I've seen this movie before and I don't want to see it again," central-bank governor Guillermo Ortiz says. "It's a bad movie."Problem is, there isn't much authorities can do to choke off rising domestic demand. Monetary policy, exercised through the corto, a mechanism that drains liquidity from the interbank market, is already tight. So, too, is fiscal policy, despite the room for relaxation afforded by strong oil prices in the past year. There is little political incentive to put an end to the fiesta, given that the most fiercely contested presidential election in Mexican history takes place in early July and that the purchasing power of most people here still hasn't recovered to the levels they enjoyed when President Ernesto Zedillo took office in 1994.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>CALGARY, Alberta -- Think Canadian natural gas will easily and cheaply cover a U.S. supply shortfall? Think again.With U.S. gas producers finding it tough to boost output, Americans are looking north to help satisfy demand. Canada supplies about 16% of the natural-gas consumed by its southern neighbor, up from 11% in 1995. But with its own productive capacity peaking, Canada isn't likely to provide a sustained fix for U.S. gas consumers, specialists here caution.That could lead to a supply crunch when a U.S. economic recovery takes hold. According to most analysts, U.S. demand for natural gas probably will expand steadily in the long term, due mainly to the fuel's increasing use in electricity generation, while domestic supply stays flat. Even in its latest short-term forecast for natural-gas demand -- revised to reflect economic fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects domestic demand rebounding by 3.9% in 2002 after falling 2% this year.To address anticipated demand growth, U.S. energy companies have been snapping up natural-gas companies and assets in Canada, made cheaper by low natural-gas prices and the strong U.S. dollar. In October, for example, Burlington Resources Inc., Houston, offered $2.1 billion for Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd., Calgary.But doubts are growing about Canada's ability to keep boosting its gas exports in the long run.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- President Clinton's press secretary got a lesson on how sensitive a subject the Federal Reserve can be.Disclosing that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan met with Mr. Clinton Wednesday night, Dee Dee Myers told reporters that the Fed chief said passage of the president's deficit-reduction plan would help keep interest rates low.But that apparently sounded too much like Mr. Greenspan was endorsing the specifics of the Clinton plan, which he hasn't. Ms. Myers later issued a written clarification saying she hadn't meant to imply that Mr. Greenspan was endorsing the president's plan. Rather, he told the president that "any credible deficit-reduction plan would help to keep longterm interest rates low."A Fed spokesman wouldn't say if Mr. Greenspan had complained. "I can tell you that the clarification is correct," he said.Separately, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen ducked a reporter's query about the possibility that the Fed may raise short-term rates. "It's the Federal Reserve's province insofar as short-term interest rates" are concerned, he said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another monetary-policy domino fell Tuesday when Seoul introduced a new round of capital controls. South Korea's financial regulators will reduce the amount of foreign-exchange forwards that banks can carry on their balance sheets. These are commitments to buy and sell Korean won or dollars at a future date, and the decision will constrain the ability of banks to serve as counterparties for rapid capital inflows. See what Ben Bernanke hath wrought?Although Seoul has a history of competitive devaluations, this week's move should be seen in a different light. The announcement steered clear of any direct reference to the Korean won's value, homing in instead on "volatility." And no wonder. The won has risen some 9% against the greenback since May. The country's economy is relatively strong, and despite recent interest-rate cuts, returns on capital invested in won remain well above America's super-low rates. This encourages more capital inflows, which in the extreme could destabilize the financial system.That isn't to say that Seoul's move is good policy in theory or will prove effective in practice. Capital controls mainly distort flows of capital, leading to inefficiencies and often other economic distortions.One reason the won has been a volatile currency is Seoul's history of capital controls: Investors pile in when times are good, then rush back out at the first hint that regulators might impose controls. Seoul hasn't helped with its promises this week to continue "monitoring" currency volatility--a reference to the possibility of future controls that could in turn spark a capital outflow.But in this case Korean leaders--and central bankers around Asia--deserve some commiseration as they struggle to control a tsunami not of their making. Washington traditionally discourages capital controls, but this is a harder case to make when Mr. Bernanke and the U.S. Federal Reserve flood foreign economies, many of them developing and with unsophisticated financial systems, with dollars.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- As bond investors return from the holiday, they still have memories of Friday's pleasant kickoff, when bonds went through the roof as investors cheered upbeat economic news. But some analysts say the rejoicing may be out of place, because the jury is still out on the Fed's next move.The price spike on Friday, the last trading day before today, was triggered by bond-friendly employment news, which eased fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. The Labor Department reported that 124,000 nonfarm employees were added to the nation's payrolls in August, a little less than half of what Wall Street had been expecting. The unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.3% in August.Meanwhile, average hourly wages increased just 0.2%, comforting investors worried that rising wages will lead to higher inflation.The news sent bond prices climbing. In preholiday trading that ended early, at 2 p.m. EDT Friday, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 17/32, or $15.313 for a bond with $1,000 face value, to 101 13/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.014%. It was the first gain for Treasurys in seven sessions.Other types of bonds, such as mortgage-backed securities, also rallied.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A major factor in the current financial crisis is the lack of transparency in the activities of the principal players in the financial markets. This opaqueness is compounded by vast sums of money that lie outside the jurisdiction of U.S. regulators and other supervisory authorities.The $700 billion in Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's current proposed rescue plan pales in comparison to the volume of dollars that now escape the watchful eye, not only of U.S. regulators, but from the media and the general public as well.There is $1.9 trillion, almost all of it run out of the New York metropolitan area, that sits in the Cayman Islands, a secrecy jurisdiction. Another $1.5 trillion is lodged in four other secrecy jurisdictions.Following the Great Depression, we bragged about a newly installed safety net that was suppose to save us from such a hard economic fall in the future. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve System, the Comptroller of the Currency and others have ignored trillions of dollars that have migrated to offshore jurisdictions that are secretive in nature and outside the safety net -- beyond the reach of U.S. regulators.We should have learned a long time ago that totally unsupervised markets, whether trading in tulips or subprime mortgages, will sooner rather than later get into trouble.

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- A flurry of weak economic data helped to end a three-day stock market rally that had taken its cue from sharply lower interest rates.Nearly every sector came under pressure as a series of economic reports reignited worries that the economy continues to falter. The reports showed a decrease in new home sales last month, a downturn in consumer confidence, and a drop in the index of May's leading economic indicators. Economists had expected higher readings for all of the figures.The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to make a slight comeback near the close, which traders attributed to endof-the-quarter mark ups.

Rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 3.74% from 3.78% the previous week and 4.20% a year earlier.Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages held steady from last week at 3.41%, but are down from 3.94% a year earlier.

    <TEXT>This week's steep drop in oil prices may mean that crude is set to turn away from the $100-a-barrel mark amid gloomy U.S. economic forecasts and hints of higher supplies.That is the good news for consumers. The bad news, energy analysts say, is that even if prices continue to slump, oil is almost certain to cost more on average next year than this year.U.S. benchmark crude dropped sharply yesterday, falling $3.28 a barrel, or 3.4%, to $94.42 in futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But analysts stopped short of calling the shift a correction. The market remains unusually volatile and could easily shoot upward again -- even breaking the $100 mark -- if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries doesn't follow through on talk of a production increase or if Western stockpiles dip unexpectedly. Oil prices hit an intraday record of $99.29 a barrel last week. Oil reached its inflation-adjusted high of $102 a barrel in April 1980.Still, analysts point to a number of reasons prices are likely to ebb as the Northern Hemisphere heads into spring next year.Topping the list is the sluggish U.S. economy, which some economists say is heading toward a recession as the meltdown of the U.S. subprime-mortgage market crimps lending. That would damp oil demand in the U.S., the world's largest oil consumer. It could also prompt a slowdown in other economies, including in China, now the fastest- growing consumer of oil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lawmakers left an extension of jobless benefits out of their budget agreement, fueling the debate over what happens to unemployed workers--and the economy--when the program expires.Many Democrats are upset that the extension wasn't included in the deal, and the White House estimates that roughly 1.3 million workers will stop receiving unemployment payments, which average $300 a week, when the program expires on Dec. 28. Republicans say the extended benefits have gone on long enough--more than five years--and argue that the checks create a disincentive for people to find work.Many economists believe such aid boosts the unemployment rate, perhaps by as much as 1 percentage point. But they differ on the reasons and on the size of the effect. Some of the unemployed might drop out of the labor force altogether without the aid; others might be spurred to search harder for a job.Now the debate is about whether current economic circumstances warrant a longer extension. Democrats argue that they do and that the current labor market is too weak to allow benefits to expire. About 4.1 million workers in the U.S. have been jobless for at least six months. That is down from a peak of 6.7 million in April 2010, but still triple the pre-recession level."Although [long-term unemployment] has come down, it is still at an unusually high level by historical standards," said Rob Valletta, economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. "That raises concern about the status of the long-term unemployed and policies that might be designed to support them."</TEXT>

The tougher the bank measures, the harder companies will be pushed to become profitable or fold, and, so the theory goes, the faster Japan will end its slump.One key point will be how Mr. Takenaka proposes to bring banks' loan valuations "into line with market valuations" -- a step pledged in the current bank-cleanup plan and in previous ones. Mr. Takenaka has proposed a method widely used in the U.S. for valuing loans based on the borrowers' future cash flow. Japan's banks have protested. Yet even if this method is implemented for big borrowers, as the plan urges, analysts say its effect will depend on how far into the future loan inspectors look, and what interest rates they use for their calculations.Another question is how Mr. Takenaka's plan will "strengthen bank capital," another old pledge. Mr. Takenaka said Friday he will study an overhaul of the tax code and a possible restriction on the amount of tax credits banks can count as capital, steps long urged by rating agencies. Yet this is controversial, since after years of write-offs, big banks' capital is so depleted that a significant accounting change could wipe it out, leading to nationalization of the lenders.If Mr. Takenaka opts for tough implementation of such steps, analysts say that some major lenders could fall under government control. The current version of the plan does mention the possibility of new legislation that would let the government inject capital into certain lenders, and it talks of a new category of "special support" financial institutions, although it doesn't say how regulators will decide which banks need support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Federal Reserve officials are on track to reduce their monthly bond buying to $45 billion at their policy meeting next week and stick with a communications approach that leaves investors guessing about when the central bank will start raising short-term interest rates."While monetary-policy discussions naturally begin with a baseline outlook, the path of the economy is uncertain, and effective policy must respond to significant unexpected twists and turns the economy may take," Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York last week, her last comments before the central bank's one-week quiet period ahead of its April 29-30 policy meeting.Her emphasis on uncertainty in the speech underscored a shift in Fed communications early in Ms. Yellen's tenure as chief. For much of the economic recovery, the Fed has tried to provide concrete assurances to investors about the path of short-term interest rates. Officials now are trying to retain some flexibility on the interest-rate outlook as they try to resolve several mysteries about the recovery, which has generated surprisingly slow economic growth, low inflation and faster declines in standard measures of unemployment than expected."Tying the response of policy to the economy necessarily makes the future course of the federal funds rate uncertain," Ms. Yellen said last week, referring to the Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate, which has been near zero since late 2008. Other Fed officials have sounded the same refrain in recent comments.In 2011 and 2012, the Fed's interest-rate assurances came in the form of promises that officials wouldn't raise rates until after certain dates passed. Then in late 2012, the Fed switched to economic markers, saying it wouldn't shift short-term rates until after the unemployment rate fell to 6.5%. The jobless rate was 6.7% in March.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Break out the poodle skirts and crank up the Perry Como.It's often said that investors these days are navigating uncharted territory. The world's major economies are swamped by massive amounts of debt, the Federal Reserve has essentially locked interest rates at zero and the outlook for corporate profits is increasingly cloudy.Many investors are paralyzed by this environment, which is unlike anything they have seen in their adult lives. As a result, they're hunkering down in cash and super-safe government bonds. However, as is often the case, investors can look to the past and find potential guideposts for building a portfolio for today's markets.In this case, history suggests that stocks with higher dividends could be in for a long period of healthy returns. Looking at the broad stock market, history suggests stocks in general could struggle compared with government bonds as long as rates are capped by the Fed, which is contrary to the conventional wisdom today. But for the longer term, stocks are a better bet than bonds.For their history lesson, investors should set their wayback machines to the period beginning in the late 1940s. It was a time when bond-market interest rates didn't float freely as they usually do, but instead were capped by the government at low levels to help the country manage the enormous debts accumulated during World War II.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Short-term interest rates fell sharply again yesterday, continuing a steep decline that began early this month.Rates on some Treasury bills tumbled by about three-eighths of a percentage point. The interest rate on federal funds, which are reserves banks lend each other, dropped to as low as 4% yesterday afternoon from Tuesday's average of 9.24%.The big drop in rates this month mainly reflects a slowdown in economic growth and a credit-easing move by the Federal Reserve System, many analysts say. But even these analysts contend that yesterday's extremely low federal funds rate probably was an aberration. Banks and savings institutions had to settle their accounts yesterday with the Fed. The funds rate often swings widely on settlement days.Interest rates have tumbled in recent weeks despite a huge volume of U.S. notes and bonds that have been sold. Yesterday, the Treasury sold $6.02 billion of new three-year, 11-month notes at an average annual yield of 11.42%. That was down sharply from 13.69% at the previous auction of similar notes last June and was the lowest auction average since last December. The Treasury also sold $1 billion of the notes in a special form, designed for foreign investors, at an average yield of 11.41%."The Fed is engaged in a rather vigorous easing" move, said Robert A. Brusca, vice president and money-market economist at Irving Trust Co. Fed officials, as usual, won't comment on current policy. But Mr. Brusca said he expects banking figures to be released this afternoon by the Fed to confirm that it has eased credit conditions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My wife was watching C-Span on television a few weeks ago, and one of the chief economists at the Congressional Budget Office was talking about budget deficits. He said they were a major crisis, but people were being misled about their severity because most of the usual indicators -- such as prices of financial assets, inflation and real economic activity -- were giving off reasonably rosy, but false, signals.My wife was skeptical. Couldn't it be that all of these indicators were right, and that the budget deficit was just not a big deal? Anyhow, where did this CBO economist get his information if not from all the data that gave different answers? Probably he was just a slave of some outmoded economic theory that predicted effects that hadn't shown up. Moreover, didn't David Ricardo have a theory that said that budget deficits were roughly equivalent to taxation, and didn't this theory conform pretty well with the evidence that this CBO fellow said we should ignore? I agreed with my wife and assured her that a growing number of economists were coming to that viewpoint, but that we still numbered only 22% of the membership of the American Economic Association.I admit that federal budget deficits since 1984 have been higher than I would have predicted, based on a model that views deficits as a device to smooth out tax collections over time. For example, the budget deficit for the current fiscal year, when measured as the change in the privately held public debt, is about $210 billion. I would have predicted a deficit of between $110 billion and $170 billion: $60 billion associated with the federal net interest payments of $130 billion, $50 billion for the persistent failure to reach full employment, and as much as $60 billion to offset the surplus of the state and local sector. That leaves an excess deficit of $40 billion to $100 billion. Smaller but still significantly positive values apply for 1984 and 1985.I see three possible explanations for the large budget deficits of recent years. First, they may simply be mistakes. In this case they are also good experiments, which economists can use to figure out the effects of budget deficits on the economy.Second, people may believe that the "Reagan Revolution" portends a declining share of federal spending in gross national product. In that case current spending is temporarily high, and it makes sense to run a budget deficit rather than to enact a temporary increase in tax rates. But I find this forecast of declining federal spending doubtful, and there is no sign of it yet in the data.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- China came under more pressure to let its currency rise as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said flatly that the yuan is "undervalued . . . to promote a more export-oriented economy" and an International Monetary Fund study suggested that a currency move wouldn't harm Chinese growth if handled properly.Mr. Bernanke, making his strongest comments on the subject in speaking before Congress's Joint Economic Committee, said, "It would be good for the Chinese to allow more flexibility in their exchange rate" to "address inflation and bubbles within their own economy" and to help bring more balance to a global economy in which China relies too much on exports and the U.S. too much on borrowing to import.But Mr. Bernanke, responding to questions from China critic Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) also said that moving the exchange rate alone wouldn't have a major short-term effect on trade flows -- though "over time it would have an impact."The Fed chairman's remarks come amid growing expectations that China will allow its currency to rise, perhaps before leaders of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing countries meet in Canada in June.The U.S. Treasury recent postponed a decision on whether to label China a "currency manipulator," an apparent effort to give China some political breathing space to revalue its currency without appearing to bow to U.S. pressure.</TEXT>

The euro pushed to a more than two-year low in early trade and was recently down 0.5% to $1.2169.U.S. gross domestic product grew 5% in the third quarter, well above last month's estimate of 3.9%, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It was the fastest pace since GDP grew 6.9% during the third quarter of 2003.The GDP data encouraged investors who have been betting that a recovering U.S. economy would spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before other major central banks do. Higher U.S. rates would bring more investors to the dollar, as they would increase returns on assets denominated in the currency."With 5% growth in the U.S. now, even if we don't improve at that pace next quarter, we're still light years ahead of the eurozone and Japan," said Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust Private Wealth Management.

    <TEXT>Although global growth is chugging along, the world's economies are exposed to an unusual number of risks, according to a report prepared for the world's central banks.The troubling signs range from record housing prices and soaring indebtedness to an ever-widening U.S. current-account deficit and remarkably low bond yields. Any shift back to more ordinary levels could potentially be "rapid and disruptive," according to a report yesterday by the Bank for International Settlements, an international organization that fosters cooperation among the world's central banks.On the whole, world-wide growth is fairly strong and inflation is tame, but many central banks are nevertheless worried. The last time the world economy faced such a confluence of imbalances was in the late 1960s. Then, the situation contributed to soaring inflation in the 1970s and the debt crises of the 1980s that affected many emerging-market economies. Most economists don't think this will happen again because the world economy is more deregulated and globalized -- which, along with inflation-focused central banks, should take the heat off excessive price increases.One of the textbook prescriptions for many of the looming problems is higher interest rates. But that can cause unemployment and unhealthfully low inflation, the report said. The challenge is to address the sources of "potential unsustainability without, in the process, inducing a marked slowdown in world growth," Nout Wellink, president of the BIS, said yesterday.It is a tricky moment for central banks, which have debated for years over how to deal with potential bubbles. There is no consensus: The U.S. Federal Reserve prefers a hands-off approach when it comes to bubbles and simply cleans up the mess afterward; the European Central Bank tries to keep bubbles from emerging to begin with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve for years has been calling on Congress and the administration to get fiscal policy under control, but the agreement reached on November 20 wasn't exactly what Fed officials had in mind. The deficit accord still faces hurdles in Congress and hardly stirred enthusiasm in financial markets. The tasks of the central bank, instead of being reduced, may actually have been increased.If the budget pact appears likely to restrain economic growth, the Fed must decide whether to offset it and, if so, how vigorously. An expansionary policy, designed to hold down interest rates, could further weaken the dollar, a prospect that worries at least some Federal Reserve officials. A deeper fall for the dollar could heighten inflation fears -- fears that still are held by some Fed officials.Most economists so far give Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan high marks for the central bank's actions since the stock-market crash on October 19. But some worries are creeping in. The Fed, as promised, flooded the banks with liquidity immediately after the crash, but the period of extreme ease ended quickly. After the first couple of weeks the central bank seemed to seek a more even keel, occasionally pulling reserves out of the banks.The situation is confusing the analysts. Those who focus on the money supply, such as Edward S. Hyman of the investment firm of C.J. Lawrence Inc., worry about a decline in M1, the narrowly defined money supply. "Now that the market has settled down," he says, "money may be stabilizing. Alternatively, these declines may indicate that the economy has weakened."On the other hand, Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of E.F. Hutton & Co., is mainly concerned about the degree of pressure on bank reserves. On that basis, he feels that the Fed is maintaining "only marginal reserve restraint."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Conference Board's index of leading indicators fell 0.5% in September, another sign that the economy could be sliding closer to recession.September's drop followed a revised 0.1% decline in August, a smaller drop than the 0.3% decline initially reported. That followed three monthly increases, which appeared to signal the economy might have stopped slowing."It looked like things were bottoming out and starting to look a little bit bitter," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. "Obviously, September has changed that."The drop in the leading index in September is the largest one-month decline since January 1996, said Ken Goldstein, economist at the Conference Board. "Without the aggressive expansionary policy being adopted by the Federal Reserve, this drop would have been much deeper," he said.Six out of the 10 indicators fell in September. The largest negative contributors to the index were stock prices and initial claims for unemployment insurance. The most significant positive contributors were money supply and interest rate spreads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The American shopper, the economy's chief engine these days, kept spending at a decent clip last month, though the General Motors Corp. strike damped overall retail sales.Sales for all retailers fell 0.4% in July from June, adjusting for seasonal factors but not for inflation, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. That was the worst performance in more than a year, and reversed a modest 0.1% rise in June.But the weakness was almost entirely at auto dealerships, which saw sales plunge 3% for the month, following a 0.6% rise in June. Analysts blamed the drop largely on the now-ended GM walkout: Excluding cars, retailers saw a decent 0.5% rise in business, more than making up for June's 0.1% decline in noncar sales.Consumers' spending predilections have taken on a heightened importance in keeping the economic expansion going, as the Asian crisis has forced a slowdown in manufacturing and threatened to curb business investment. Despite daily news of Asia's deterioration, though, American consumer confidence remains high."The consumer is continuing to carry the load for the economy," said Joel Naroff, an economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Philadelphia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Institutional stock market commissions, which fell steadily for a decade after deregulation in 1975, finally appear to be leveling off.Money managers are paying an average 7.2 cents a share for their stock market trades, according to a recent survey by SEI Corp., a Wayne, Pa., pension consultant. That's nearly level with the 7.3 cents a share a year earlier, SEI says. By contrast, institutional commissions averaged 10.4 cents a share in 1979 and 25 cents a share in 1975."I think institutions realize that if they keep squeezing prices down, the service they get from brokers will be squeezed too," says Gil Beebower, an SEI senior vice president. In particular, he says, lower commissions would hurt brokers' ability to provide stock market research or to handle difficult trades.Meanwhile, securities firms welcome the break in commission price-cutting. "We aren't at all unhappy," says Brian Barefoot, director of global broker-dealer operations at Merrill Lynch & Co. He says that the profitability of Merrill's institutional equity operations is "up fairly significantly from last year" and that steady commission rates seem to be benefiting other securities firms as well.Cheaper commissions, of course, have been a major factor in surging stock market volume. In 1986, New York Stock Exchange daily trading averaged 140 million shares, compared with less than 40 million shares a day in 1979 and less than 20 million shares in the early 1970s. With average commissions at slightly more than seven cents a share, institutions and other major investors are able to trade more frequently, at lower cost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most technology companies are considering cutting back their use of stock options to reward employees or changing to other forms of stock compensation, in a further sign that the glory days of stock options are past, according to a survey of top executives in the high-tech industry.In the survey of top corporate executives at 196 companies by the technology, media and telecommunications practice of consulting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 65% of tech companies overall and 83% of public companies say they are looking at alternatives to stock options, which grant employees and executives the right to buy company stock at a fixed price during a specified period. Instead, most public technology companies, 63%, plan to issue restricted stock or stock units -- actual awards of stock or promises to grant such stock in the future.The results of the survey show the extent to which technology companies are shifting away from a form of compensation that made fortunes for many tech workers in the 1990s. Options have fallen out of favor among rank-and-file employees as stock-market declines made many options worthless. At the same time, investors and regulators have blamed option plans for their role in scandals at companies like Enron Corp., where executives cashed out large numbers of options before bad news broke. Already, high-profile tech companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. have stopped issuing options to employees in favor of restricted stock units.Another factor in the changes, the Deloitte survey says, is a coming "drought" in options: Seventy-two percent of the survey's respondents expect to run out of shares to grant to employees within two years. New rules adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market this year require shareholder approval of new stock compensation plans.Many technology companies continue to resist dropping options, in part because favorable accounting rules have allowed them to exclude option expenses from their financial results. Accounting regulators are expected eventually to require companies to treat options as an expense. Still, 92% of public tech companies surveyed by Deloitte said they aren't expensing stock options yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Bond prices spurted yesterday as dealers and investors were cheered by a decline in short-term interest rates.An injection of reserves by the Federal Reserve System into the banking network also encouraged traders. Some analysts were surprised by the move and said it might represent an easing of the Fed's credit hold. But many others insisted that the move was needed for technical reasons and that the Fed hasn't changed policy.The interest rate on federal funds hovered between 8 1/8% and 8 3/8% yesterday, down from Monday's average of 8.57%. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend one another overnight, is watched closely for clues to changes in Fed policy. Prices of some actively traded Treasury bonds rose more than 1/2 point, or over $5 for each $1,000 face amount.Much of the credit markets' focus yesterday was on the Fed's injection of reserves. The action "could possibly represent an easing move" by the central bank, said Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Refco Partners. He cautioned, however, that it is "premature to attach any definitive policy significance" to the Fed maneuver.The economy's apparent sluggishness in recent months has boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease credit conditions, paving the way for lower interest rates, in an attempt to stimulate business activity. This view was bolstered last week when Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker expressed concern about the lackluster performance of the nation's manufacturing industries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Conference Board's index of leading indicators moved up slightly in March, signaling that U.S. economic expansion probably will continue vigorously through 1998.Michael D. Boldin, director of business-cycle research at the New York business-research organization, said the economic omens point to continued strong growth in gross domestic product in the months ahead."It looks like above 3% is not impossible for the whole year," Mr. Boldin said. Last week, the government reported that the economy expanded in the first quarter at an annualized rate of 4.2%, but few economists believe that pace is sustainable through the rest of the year. The leading-indicators index, considered a reasonable predictor of turning points in the economy, measured 105.2, up from 105 in February.The March increase came largely from two of the 10 components that make up the index: stock prices and money supply. Both of those measures reflect the strength of financial markets and are considered fairly reliable indicators of the strength of future economic growth, not just of whether the economy will stay out of recession.Other increases were seen in orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a measure of suppliers' delivery times. Declines were seen in big-ticket orders to manufacturers, excluding defense contracts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TORONTO -- Facing an industry slowdown, Canadian laser eye-surgery provider TLC Laser Eye Centers Inc. agreed to acquire rival Laser Vision Centers Inc., St. Louis, for $98.7 million in stock, creating North America's biggest operator of laser eye-surgery clinics.The deal brings together TLC's strength in urban centers with Laser Vision's share of the market in smaller towns and rural areas of the U.S., said TLC Chairman and Chief Executive Elias Vamvakas. The combination also will create about $10 million a year in cost savings and growth opportunities, said John J. Klobnak, Laser Vision's chairman and CEO."The industry has seen a slowdown," and "the street has been begging for consolidation in this industry," Mr. Klobnak said. Laser Vision has taken a step toward consolidation by agreeing to acquire closely held ClearVision Laser Centers, Lakewood, Colo., earlier this month for an amount that wasn't disclosed.TLC said it is offering 0.95 of its shares for each Laser Vision share. Shares of Laser Vision jumped 62 cents, or 21%, to $3.63 in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while TLC shares fell 33 cents, or 7.6% to $4.01. Both companies' shares trade at a fraction of their historic highs. In 1999, Laser Vision reached $37 a share, while TLC hit $53 a share.Demand soared in the late 1990s for laser treatment to correct astigmatism, nearsightedness and farsightedness, but it has leveled off during the past year. Analysts and industry officials say the economic slowdown has prompted consumers to delay the elective procedure, which is deemed cosmetic and isn't covered by most insurance plans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There evidently was a failure to communicate in my interview with your reporter on drug prices ("Harsh Medicine: Attack on Drug Prices Opens Clinton's Fight for Health-Care Plan," page one, Feb. 16). I am quoted as saying that the pharmaceutical industry "deserved" the wrath of the current administration. I merely meant that the industry should have seen some such wrath coming. To see a hurricane coming, of course, does not mean one "deserves" it. It merely means one should be prepared for it.In more than 20 years of teaching economics and finance at Princeton I have consistently offered my students the following normative proposition: In a capitalist society, the explicitly stated social responsibility of investor-owned entities is to maximize their owners' wealth without violating the laws of the land. It can be said that the investor-owned pharmaceutical industry has legitimately owned up to that mandate during the past decade. At the same time, it can also be said that the social fallout from that policy has raised legitimate political concerns. That is part and parcel of a democracy.It is true that spending on pharmaceutical products represents only 7% to 8% of total national health spending. It is also true that total annual spending on medicine typically lags behind total annual consumer spending on alcohol and tobacco. But as early as 1982 I sought to alert executives of the industry to the fact that spending on their products represents a huge hit on the budgets of low-income, chronically ill people who typically lack insurance for prescription drugs, and that sooner or later this fiscal distress would trigger legitimate concerns among politicians.Throughout the 1980s I urged members of the industry to recover their huge overhead costs mainly from middle- and upper-income households, and not from chronically ill poor people. That could have been achieved either by urging on Congress coverage for medicine for all low-income people (a strategy used in other countries) or through some analogue of food stamps, a special discount credit card or some other price-discriminatory device. I recall that idea being laughed off as "Ivy League socialism" during the heady 1980s. In retrospect, it may appear as good politico-economic advice.The industry's failure to deal with these political pressures pre-emptively does not "deserve" punishment.

    <TEXT>STOCK INDEXES finished the quarter with a whimper, but still turned in one of their strongest quarterly performances in years.With a decline of 3.61 points, to 8985.44 yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average failed to return to the 9000 level. Yet its red-hot spring rally left the blue-chip index up 12% for the past three months and up 7.7% for the first half of the year. It was the first time the industrial average has finished a first half with a gain since 1999, the last year of the bull market that ended more than three years ago.U.S. stock mutual funds jumped an average of more than 17% for the quarter, the strongest performance since the fourth quarter of 1999, according to preliminary numbers calculated by Lipper Inc. through Friday. (Lipper completes the final quarterly tally today.)Some market analysts view the recent rally as a positive sign for those hoping the indexes can break a three-year streak of annual losses. But analysts also noted that stocks now seem to be drifting sideways after hitting a peak on June 17. For much of the spring, professional investors bought stocks in hopes that government stimulation would provoke an economic recovery. Now, increasingly, money managers are in a "show me" mode, looking for signs of the recovery.Major companies are poised to begin announcing second-quarter results in about a week, at which time they also will be providing investors with readings on whether business conditions really are improving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>International Business Machines Corp. gave details about sharp cutbacks in New York's Hudson Valley, edging closer to making layoffs in an area that was the cradle of its modern-day business.As part of its plan to cut 25,000 workers this year, IBM said 3,000 to 3,500 employees would leave three of the company's New York plants -- East Fishkill, Poughkeepsie and Kingston -- at the end of the current quarter. Together, the plants currently employ about 21,500 workers.IBM said it hopes it can keep alive its hallowed "full employment" tradition by achieving all the cuts through voluntary incentive programs available until March 5. But Big Blue signaled that this is an unlikely outcome, and said its first layoffs in a half-century could come in East Fishkill during the second quarter.The news had been expected. All three facilities are closely associated with IBM's mainframe-computer operation, which was targeted for the company's harshest cuts: East Fishkill supplies the chips that serve as "brains" for mainframes, while Poughkeepsie and Kingston develop and make the bulky machines.East Fishkill will take the brunt of the latest cutbacks, possibly losing as many as 2,500 of its 9,200 workers, an IBM spokeswoman said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The West German central bank, as expected, cut the interest rate it charges on securities-repurchase agreements with banks, a move that appears likely to fall short of its goal of supporting the dollar by widening the gap between German and U.S. interest rates.The Bundesbank yesterday called for interest-rate tenders on 28-day securities-repurchase agreements at a minimum rate of 3.5%, well below the 3.8% rate it had been asking since January. Market experts estimate that the actual rate to emerge from bidding today is likely to be closer to 3.6% or 3.65%. But they expect the Bundesbank to use later tenders to continue to push the rate lower, possibly to 3.3%.The repurchase facility is the central bank's principal open-market means for refinancing the banking system with funds backed by securities. Yesterday's Bundesbank action signals broad declines in capital-market interest rates, and could lead to lower credit rates charged by commercial banks.The West German move complements a recent lowering of short-term interest rates in Japan and a tightening of credit by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. Those two steps were aimed at stabilizing exchange rates.However, foreign-exchange traders said the Bundesbank's action didn't have any immediate effect on the currency market and that small interest-rate movements are unlikely to significantly outweigh other factors weakening the dollar, including the U.S. trade deficit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another quarter filled with worry. Another batch of record-smashing performances.For the past two quarters the stock market has blithely ignored nervous calls for some sort of correction. Instead, prices have risen without interruption since last December, and major averages hover close to recently established record levels.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged an astonishing 864.99 points, or more than 23%, since dipping to 3691.11 on Dec. 9. But as the third quarter opens, the same nervousness remains on Wall Street."I'm pessimistic," says Thomas McManus, market strategist at Morgan Stanley. "I'd like to see a period where the stock market was going up in anticipation of an expanding economy, with consumer confidence low and the bulk of improvements in profits ahead of us. But that's not the case right now."Indeed, earnings have been unquestionably strong in the past year and have become one source of worry as the economy slows. And many analysts argue that the tremendous surge in the bond market, which has pushed yields sharply lower, gives that market little more positive room to maneuver. Many economists worry that if the Federal Reserve doesn't lower rates this week at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting, interest rates could start to inch higher, and hopes for a reacceleration in economic growth could fade.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sales of previously owned homes rose 1.9% in June as the national housing recovery maintained a slow but steady momentum, fueled by low interest rates and pent-up consumer demand.Existing-home sales rose to 3,690,000 on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, from a revised pace of 3,620,000 in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. Regional performance was mixed, with the West and Midwest posting slight decreases in sales while the South gained modestly and the long-suffering Northeast snapped back with a 14% gain.The results come after a disappointing report by the Commerce Department showing housing starts flat in June from the previous month. The new-home market isn't performing as well as the one for existing homes, analysts say, because some builders still have a tough time getting credit to build, and bad weather earlier this year delayed construction. The flooding in the Midwest won't help starts this month, and could channel more demand into the resale market."If you have softness on new homes, that puts additional pressure for consumers to buy existing homes," added Daryl Jesperson, executive vice president of Re/Max International Inc., a national broker based in Englewood, Colo.Though slowed from May's increase of 4.9%, the June resale numbers mark the third consecutive month of gains for nationwide resales following three consecutive down months that were attributable to bad weather. Compared with a year ago, the June resales were up a vibrant 11.1%, with double-digit growth in the South and Midwest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The precious metals rally derailed as platinum and gold prices plummeted amid heavy profit-taking.Platinum prices for immediate delivery, which had risen 31% in the past month alone, plunged $29.50, to $646.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the sharpest daily decline on the platinum market in 3 1/2 years, exchange officials said. The active October contract fell $25 an ounce, to $652.70. Gold prices followed suit, with the October contract at the Commodity Exchange in New York tumbling $11.80, to $412.50 an ounce.Traders and analysts attributed some of the sell-off to a stronger U.S. dollar and weaker oil prices, which tend to keep a lid on inflation. Many traders hold precious metals, especially gold, as an inflation hedge. A weaker dollar and early whiffs of inflation have been cited among other factors in precious metals' recent rise.But despite the economic factors, many analysts said a correction was simply due. "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that platinum is vulnerable" at these levels, said Gail Levey, platinum analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York.William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., New York, added that the sharp decline indicates that the precious metals rally could soon fizzle.

"If you're very uncertain about how strong the improvement in the economy is, and how self-sustaining, then you should move in fairly small increments," Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview Wednesday with The Wall Street Journal.Mr. Rosengren, a strong supporter of the easy-money policies, said he was still forming a judgment about whether the economy was improving as expected.

    <TEXT>Easy Money Tugs Two Ways at Trade GapThe trade deficit is a case study in the unintended consequences of easy money.The Commerce Department releases April trade data Wednesday morning. Economists think the deficit widened a bit, to $29 billion, from $27.6 billion in March. That would end an eight-month streak of narrower deficits that has cut the gap roughly in half, thanks first to a surge in exports and then to tumbling oil prices.A narrower trade deficit is potentially good economic news on several fronts. For one, from an accounting perspective, exports add to gross domestic product, while imports subtract from it. From a fundamental standpoint, it is often healthier for a country to export more than it imports -- though collapsing imports can also signal weak demand at home, as they have in this recession.Here's where the unintended consequences of fighting that recession come in: The money being pumped into the economy by the Federal Reserve has made some investors anxious about inflation, sometimes defined as the result of too much money chasing too few goods.</TEXT>

They were everywhere.But before someone gets a book proposal pitching the story of Goldman's unprecedented dominance, let's turn the calendar back four score or so. Then, another little banking firm you may have heard of, J.P. Morgan, looked like the boss of the Big Board -- and everything else financial, too. In fact, before the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the House of Morgan was the country's de facto central bank, John Brooks, the now deceased New Yorker magazine writer, reminded us in his book, "Once in Golconda, a True Drama of Wall Street 1920-1938."Consider the stock-market crash, for example. A few minutes after noon on Black Thursday in 1929, when "a kind of Homeric catalogue of the banking chieftains of the time" gathered to engineer a consortium to bail out the market, they did so at J.P. Morgan's 23 Wall St. building, Mr. Brooks wrote. About 90 minutes later, Morgan's principal broker, Richard Whitney, entered the New York Stock Exchange and strode to the U.S. Steel post, where he bid for 10,000 shares at 205 -- the last price the stock had sold at but well above where it was being offered when Mr. Whitney arrived. "Richard Whitney Halts Stock Panic," headlines declared the next day. Mr. Whitney became the personification of Wall Street, a bona fide national hero. He would go on to run the exchange, although his own investing improprieties would later see him declare bankruptcy and serve time in Sing Sing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TAIWAN'S ECONOMY has shifted into high gear, with stronger-than-expected growth.Economists have raised their 1986 economic-output estimates because of a recovery in exports, low oil prices and falling interest rates. The government's Council for Economic Planning and Development originally set a 5.5% target for growth this year in Taiwan's inflation-adjusted gross national product, the nation's output of goods and services. Now, however, officials say they expect GNP to increase at least 7%. In 1985, GNP grew 4.7%."The general economic tone is good," says Mark Mobius, president of the International Investment Trust Co., which manages stock-market funds in Taiwan. "I wouldn't be surprised to see 8% growth this year."Exports, the driving force in Taiwan's economy, have bounced back, totaling $5.39 billion in the first two months of 1986, up 11.3% from a year earlier. The strengthening of the U.S. economy helped boost exports to that nation 15% during the period, to $2.85 billion. A drop in the value of Taiwan's currency, which makes Taiwanese products more price competitive abroad, also is a factor.One cloud on the horizon for business is the introduction in Taiwan next Tuesday of a value-added tax of 5% on all transactions. Economists and government officials say this could cause a mild acceleration in inflation.</TEXT>

What's more, Italy's chances of participating in Europe's single currency plan from the start hang in the balance as the country tries to put together a temporary government that can pass its 1998 budget. Meantime, U.S.-Japanese trade tensions have resurfaced in force, beating the dollar back below 120.00 yen.Late Friday in New York the dollar was quoted at 1.7485 marks, up from 1.7435 marks late Thursday in New York. The U.S. currency also was quoted at 119.85 yen, down from 121.14 yen. Sterling fell to $1.6215 from $1.6244. About noon Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 120.23 yen and at 1.7508 marks."There isn't a [market] trend at this point. It's more just a matter of being reactive," said Scott Pardee, a senior adviser at Yamaichi International America in New York.The renewed expectation of higher rates in the U.S. should lend some support to the dollar, especially if data on prices, sales and production slated for release this week provide Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan with ammunition to follow up on his intimations of higher rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Three cheers for David Ranson ("If Real Interest Rates Haven't Changed," editorial page, April 3). He has clearly demonstrated one more time the relationship between real and nominal interest rates as determined by inflation and expectations of future inflation. Historically over the years the zero-risk real cost of money (interest rate) has varied relatively little from three to four percent. Traditionally, rate "surcharges" are added to offset, or insure against, perceived risks in a given investment opportunity; the higher the inherent risk, the higher the nominal rate demanded.Then came the steeply rising inflation of the recent past. These years taught investors a painful lesson. The "surcharge" added to cover the risk of expected inflation was grossly and routinely underestimated, and real interest rates actually went negative. While lenders suffered losses, borrowers loved their bonanza and have come to expect that it should continue to their benefit.Lenders have good reason to be gun-shy. It matters not what scares the lender, be it large deficits or something else real or imagined. Each lender judgmentally sets his perception of the proper minimum add-on to cover expected inflation within the life of the investment, and fixes his acceptable rates accordingly. For the most part investor collective judgment will be borne out (or will be adjusted with time) except under conditions of steep change; i.e., runaway inflation or a bust.Real interest rates are not high; they change little. It is lender analysis of risk that sets the pattern of nominal rates. Currently it is the fear and anticipation of future inflation that is at the center of lender thinking. Tax rates are hardly relevant. And the idea of lenders being willing to accept rates which may give negative real returns is only for fairy tales.R.E. Morrison</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A hike in the national minimum wage seems all but certain to become one of the first fruits of the Democrats' victories this week. Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive Speaker of the House, has pledged to raise the minimum by over $2, to $7.25 from $5.15. And President Bush has already signaled he'd go along. At the state level, six states not only approved minimum wage hikes in referendums this week but indexed the minimum to inflation going forward. We hope Mr. Bush fights off any attempt at federal indexation and insists on a provision to protect small business.Raising the minimum wage has been a hardy perennial of the left for decades now. What is striking is the degree to which is has come to be seen as an economic free lunch. Even some reputedly unbiased economists have started to tout the view that raising the minimum wage has no discernible effect on job creation.But if this were true, they'd be calling for a $10, $20 or even $50- an-hour minimum wage. They're not, and neither is Nancy Pelosi. That's because the law of demand is one of the most dependable precepts of economics. It says that when the price of something goes up, demand for it goes down. An employee's wages are the price the employer pays for his services, so raising their wages means forcing employers to pay more for workers. The price goes up and there is downward pressure on demand for workers. Other things being equal, jobs are lost.For a long time, this was so obvious that no serious person doubted it. But a couple of studies in the 1990s purported to find no evidence of job loss associated with minimum-wage hikes, and it's been off to the races ever since. Classical economics teaches that for a given job, there is a market-clearing price -- the price at which both someone is willing to do it and someone else is willing to pay them to do it. If you raise the legal minimum above that price, you may get more people willing to perform the job, but you'll probably also get less people (employers) willing to pay the new, higher price to get the job done.To picture how this works, think about the grocery bagger in the supermarket, a classic low-wage service job. Supermarkets hire grocery baggers for the minimum wage, or close to it, because it's a perk that makes their customers' experience a bit nicer and helps move the lines along, possibly requiring fewer cashiers, who cost more to hire than grocery baggers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A sudden surge in U.S. interest rates has dimmed the luster of some of the bond world's brightest stars.Bill Gross, Dan Fuss, Jeffrey Gundlach and Michael Hasenstab were among portfolio managers whose funds posted losses during the second quarter.The tumble in Treasury prices led to the biggest-ever quarterly loss for Mr. Gross's $268 billion Pimco Total Return fund. Investors in the fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., a unit of Allianz SE of Germany, have lost more money than holders of the average bond fund this year, a rare setback for a manager who has consistently beaten the market over more than two decades. Of the four large bond funds, Pimco Total Return was the only one to trail its benchmark in the second quarter and full year.The culprit: a rapid rise in Treasury yields that started in May amid fears the Federal Reserve would pull back its stimulus. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen about a percentage point since early May. On Thursday, the yield fell to 2.576%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.The reversal was particularly brutal for holders of emerging-market bonds and Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, which compensate investors for rising inflation. Neither bet panned out as funds rushed out of poorer-country markets and U.S. inflation softened. Mr. Gross allocated 18% in the two asset classes in the bond fund at the end of May, according to Pimco.</TEXT>

Nymex prices traded in a narrow range for most of the session as market participants chose to wait until Wednesday afternoon for potential clarity on the Fed's easy-money policies."It's a directionless trade," said John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital LLC, a New York hedge fund that focuses on energy, referring to the lack of significant price movement.He added, "You can make a strong argument on both sides, and there's a lot of room for the Fed to surprise us either way."Many traders expect the Fed to begin scaling back its so-called quantitative-easing program, in which it buys $85 billion each month in mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury bonds, in the near future. The program has boosted oil prices by weakening the dollar, making crude cheaper to buy with other currencies.</TEXT>

Other companies also announced GM-related hits.More bad news is sure to follow this week as companies prepare investors for the worst.

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON--New applications for unemployment benefits fell again last week, a fresh sign of an improving labor market.Initial claims for jobless aid decreased by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 302,000 in the week ended July 12, the Labor Department said Thursday. That was the second lowest reading so far this year and was below the 310,000 new claims forecast by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, fell by 3,000 to 309,000, its lowest level in seven years. A year ago, this measure stood at 345,000."The improvement has been substantial," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Jobless claims traditionally jump this time of year because of temporary layoffs at auto-manufacturing plants, so the Labor Department adjusts the data in order to give a better picture of the underlying trend of layoffs. Auto makers traditionally halt production at some factories in the first half of July to prepare for model year changeovers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The economy grew at a strong 4.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, the Commerce Department said, rather than the 3.9% rate estimated by the agency last month.The large revision in the inflation-adjusted gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services, was due principally to an unexpected reduction in December's trade deficit from the earlier estimate. For its earlier GNP report, the department had estimated that the December trade deficit would approach $10 billion, but in fact the deficit, as reported three weeks ago, was $8.2 billion. The deficit is a negative factor in calculating the GNP.Most analysts believe the easing in the trade deficit is temporary, resulting from the economy's slowdown in the third quarter. They expect the rapid growth of the economy in the fourth quarter, combined with the continued strength of the dollar, to cause the deficit to get even larger next year.The economy grew at a sluggish 1.6% rate in the third quarter. GNP in the fourth quarter of 1984 was 5.9% over the fourth quarter of 1983, rather than 5.6% as reported last month. And the full-year's output was 6.9% higher than in 1983, rather than 6.8% as previously reported.The strong growth in the fourth quarter makes it clear that the economy began 1985 with considerable momentum.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The stock market has its own discount store, and analysts say prices have rarely been cheaper.The discounts can be found among closed-end funds, those peculiar mutual funds that trade on the stock exchange. You think stocks and bonds look attractive? Closed-end funds offer the chance to buy into these markets -- at marked down prices."There are quite remarkable values right now," says George Foot, managing partner of New York's Newgate Management Associates. "This is the time when you should step up to the table and enjoy the feast."How do closed-end funds differ from regular mutual funds? If you trade a regular fund, you simply buy or sell shares from the fund involved. The only price you need worry about is the fund's net asset value, which is the value of the fund's portfolio holdings expressed on a per-share basis.But with closed-end funds, you also have to keep tabs on a fund's publicly traded shares. Unlike regular mutual funds, closed-end funds issue only a limited number of shares. The fund is then closed, and its shares are listed on the stock market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A surge in durable goods orders showed life in the manufacturing sector, while claims for jobless benefits rose, another troublesome sign for the labor markets.Manufacturers' orders for goods designed to last three years increased 3.0% last month, to a seasonally adjusted $175.75 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had projected a 1.5% climb in durables, which include cars, computers, and toasters."Over the course of the year, new orders have been gently climbing amid substantial volatility, suggesting that new orders have troughed and are now recovering after falling significantly in 2008," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood said.But the report had its soft spots. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, for instance, fell, by 2.9%. The orders are seen as a barometer of capital spending by businesses. Non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft shipments, used in calculating gross domestic product, fell 1.5%. The declines caused Macroeconomic Advisers to lower its tracking forecast of gross domestic product growth in the first quarter, by one-tenth to 3.0%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The bears went on the offensive in the Treasury market Friday after a data deluge further eroded fading hopes for a Fed rate cut this year.With a 5% yield on the benchmark 10-year note a hair's breadth away, some investors already are bracing for more of a bear run.Within 90 minutes, Treasury traders were hit by some of the most significant numbers on the U.S. economic calendar. First, there were data on nonfarm payrolls and personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's favored inflation gauge. Rounding things off were the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey, the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer-sentiment survey and pending home sales.If this economic Super Friday had revealed across-the-board economic weakness, it could easily have blunted -- and may have reversed -- a Treasury-market bear run that saw prices slide through most of May.It wasn't so. What proved to be mixed economic data kept the selling pressure intact and lifted the yield on the 10-year note to 4.955%. And with market momentum as strong as it is and traders talking of accelerating mortgage-related selling, the risk of falling deep in the red looks significant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the economy has left its soft spot behind and that companies' pricing power is more evident, suggesting more interest-rate increases are to come.Mr. Greenspan also focused on new risks to the economic outlook, specifically high housing prices. In a report released yesterday, the Fed said the value of all U.S. housing climbed 15% in the first quarter from a year earlier, and mortgage debt rose 13%, both easily outstripping the 6% gain in after-tax income over the same period."The soft readings on the economy observed in the early spring" did not presage "a more-serious slowdown," Mr. Greenspan told Congress's Joint Economic Committee. Though there have been periods of weakness during the expansion, they are "backing and filling. . . . Instead of the economy going very smoothly forward it goes in little cycles. And hence, it's often misread as though we're about to tilt into a recession."He said inflation was "contained," but cited risks: slowing productivity growth, which makes it more costly for firms to boost sales, and "evidence of increased pricing power."The Fed has raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3% in eight quarter-point steps from 1% last June. Mr. Greenspan didn't address future rate moves, but quoted from the Fed's May 3 statement that interest rates would likely continue to rise at a "measured" pace. That has come to mean a quarter point per meeting. His commentary suggested that the Fed, contrary to recent speculation, probably will raise rates at least a few more times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HONOLULU -- Chase Manhattan Corp. said it will seek Federal Reserve Board clearance to underwrite mutual funds and corporate debt securities if the current Congress doesn't grant such powers to commercial banks.Thomas Labrecque, president of the nation's second-largest banking company, made the comments at the annual convention of the American Bankers Association here, as bankers increasingly conclude that Congress will adjourn soon without amending or repealing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which limits banks' underwriting powers."We're ready to file," Mr. Labrecque said. "We won't let grass grow under our feet, but we'd like to wait and see if we get legislation first."The Chase executive stopped short of saying that the bank also would ask the Fed for authority to underwrite corporate equities, such as common stocks. However, Chase bankers have said the bank would seek this power eventually.Mr. Labrecque said that the jurisdictional dispute between Rep. Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has made it unlikely that the House will act before adjourning. Earlier this year, over the objections of securities firms, the Senate passed a bill expanding banks' securities powers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not with a bang but with a whimper. That's how the Clinton-Gore economy stumbles to an end. It's not a pretty sight. But will we end up mired in recession? Don't bet on it. We should skirt a recession and resume our prosperous march, as long as Congress supports, rather than undermines, President-elect George W. Bush.As we enter the Christmas retail season, it's easy to come up with a list of sad data as long as Santa's happy list of holiday gifts. Durable goods orders dropped 5.5% in October and, of course, the Nasdaq Stock Market has lost 32% in 2000. The economic bears are on a rampage, forcing the bulls to hibernate for the winter.How did we get here? Wasn't it just yesterday that gross domestic product growth was galloping at a 5% pace and financial authors sparked a bidding war over Dow 36,000, Dow 40,000 or Dow 100,000? Who broke up the party and launched this battle against our prosperity? Let's use the acronym FOE, pointing our indignant finger at the Federal Reserve Board, OPEC and the euro. Each of these institutions has knocked us a few degrees off course. Of the three, at least the Federal Reserve had good intentions.Back on May 16, the day the Fed pushed up short-term rates by 50 basis points, I suggested on this page that the economy was preparing to slow on its own, and that bond bears worried too much about inflation. (If only my bet on the New York Mets came out so lucky.) "Be careful what you wish for. . ." goes the old saw. So now the Fed has achieved the slowdown it tried to engineer. Fewer cars are rolling off the assembly lines in Detroit, and carpenters will hammer fewer nails into new homes this winter. The junk-bond market has slammed its doors, and the Fed reports that bank loan officers have choked lending standards tighter today than during the 1998 credit crunch.On Tuesday, Alan Greenspan prudently and presciently softened his inflation warnings, pointing out that a flabby stock market could "signal or precipitate a softening" in spending. For now, at least, we don't have to fret about irrational exuberance in share prices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>U.S. stocks notched their biggest weekly jump in two years, as investors pounced on fresh data suggesting the economy could be slogging its way out of its recent malaise.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up up 168.43 points, or 1.4%, to 12582.77 on Friday, for a 5.4% gain for the week, its best performance on a percentage basis since July 2009. By points--the Dow tacked on 648.19 in five days--the Dow had its best week since November 2008.Driving the gains was an easing in anxiety over the U.S. economy and Europe's debt troubles. On Friday, an update on the U.S. manufacturing sector showed brisk expansion in June, representing one of the month's first prominent readings on the economy.The report was especially well-taken a day after a regional manufacturing survey of Chicago-area purchasing managers for June that also handily beat economists' expectations."This is a great indication that the manufacturing sector is turning around," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. "I expect manufacturing will take us out of the soft patch and lead economic growth in the second half of the year."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>General Electric Co. reported signs of a slow global economic recovery, even as it posted a 42% third-quarter earnings decline driven by lower-than-expected revenue and more write-downs at its finance unit."The global environment has definitely improved," Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told investors. "We are expecting a gradual recovery."GE, of Fairfield, Conn., posted net income of $2.49 billion, or 23 cents a share, down from $4.31 billion, or 43 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 20% to $37.8 billion from $47.2 billion, on declining orders for industrial equipment and the ongoing shrinkage of the finance unit, known as GE Capital.Earnings at GE Capital fell 87% to $263 million amid rising delinquencies and write-downs at its consumer, business-loan and commercial-real-estate units. A tax benefit helped the results.The real-estate group swung to a $538 million loss from a $244 million profit a year ago. Delinquencies in the $84 billion real-estate portfolio rose to 4.19%, from 0.19% a year ago. GE said delinquency rates in its consumer-loan portfolio appeared to have "leveled off" in the third quarter at 4.78%, up from 2.74% a year ago.</TEXT>

In the first quarter, the company took a $5.3 billion charge against earnings related to its 2000 merger with TV Guide Inc. The second-quarter loss widened from a loss of $134.8 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier.Gemstar failed to certify its financial results by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Aug. 14 deadline, as auditors continued to review its books for possible accounting problems. Gemstar's results remain uncertified until the auditors finish their review.For the quarter, revenue fell 15% to $271.7 million. Gemstar had revenue declines at both its TV Guide and patent-licensing units, but revenue was up at its interactive unit because of increased "e-commerce" revenue and wagering activities on its horse-racing channels.Once boasting a market capitalization of more than $25 billion, Gemstar now is struggling to remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market as its stock has collapsed to under $5 a share and a market cap of almost $2 billion. Gemstar executives met yesterday with Nasdaq officials in hopes of preventing its stock from being delisted. In 4 p.m. trading, Gemstar shares were off 10%, or 34 cents, at $2.90.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. boosted its August sales-growth forecast and said it may post its largest monthly sales gain in more than a year, a sign that consumer spending continues to accelerate despite setbacks such as the blackout that struck much of the Northeast and Midwest two weeks ago.The world's largest retailer said sales at stores open more than a year should increase 4% to 6%, somewhat better than its previous estimate of 3% to 5%. Although modest, the sales gains would be the largest such increase for the retailing giant in more than a year.The improved forecast is the latest evidence that a nascent economic recovery is under way. Although battered by terrorism, war and economic uncertainty following the collapse of the Internet bubble, consumer spending has been a mainstay of the weak U.S. economy, fueled most recently by low interest rates that sparked a home-refinancing boom.Wal-Mart attributed the improved forecast to a greater-than-expected number of shoppers and larger average purchases, bolstered by a cut in tax withholding and tax-refund checks of as much as $400 a child."People seem to be more inclined to shop right now," said Tom Williams, a spokesman for the Bentonville, Ark., discount retailer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Prices of Treasury bonds slumped yesterday as dealers and investors were shaken by a sharp drop in the U.S. dollar's value against other major currencies.Some actively traded U.S. government bonds fell more than half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Interest rates declined at the weekly auction of Treasury bills, but most other short-term rates rose.Adding to investor jitters was a rise in the price of oil. Prices of gold and other precious metals viewed as harbingers of inflation also rose."Investors are growing increasingly concerned that the dollar's weakness could make foreigners reluctant to buy dollar-denominated securities," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. Foreign investors have purchased large amounts of Treasury bonds in recent years, helping the U.S. government finance its huge budget deficits.Furthermore, a continued drop in the dollar might rekindle inflationary pressures and cause the Federal Reserve not to ease credit, some investment managers say. Analysts generally have been expecting the Fed to drive interest rates lower to try to to stimulate economic growth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Federal Reserve on Friday released 1,865 pages of transcripts of its behind-closed-doors policy meetings in 2008, the year of the worst financial crisis in generations. The Fed announced the outcome of the meetings right after they occurred, and it released minutes summarizing the discussions a few weeks later. But these documents reveal for the first time officials' verbatim remarks during the heat of many difficult moments that year. Among the insights they provide:1. The Fed was often behind the curve"A perception has developed that we are tentative and indecisive," then-Chairman Ben Bernanke warned his colleagues in January 2008. At times, he moved aggressively to cut short-term interest rates; at others, he held back. After Lehman Brothers collapsed, he thought monetary policy, with short-term interest rates at 2%, was in the right place. By year-end, he acknowledged the Fed was at a "historic juncture" and moved aggressively to unconventional policies to avert another depression.2. Janet Yellen's forecasting record was mixedThe current Fed chairwoman said in March 2008 that history would probably show a recession had started in November 2007. That was a good call: The National Bureau of Economic Research put the date at December 2007. Ms. Yellen is highly regarded for her ability to read the economy, but she also makes mistakes. In June 2008, she guessed the Fed's next move would be interest-rate increases to fight inflation before year-end. Instead, the Fed continued cutting rates through the year.</TEXT>

But trading volume was sluggish as dealers awaited details of the lengthy budget negotiations between Reagan administration officials and congressional leaders."Right now, the government market is a captive of the budgetary process," said Alfred G.

"Nobody is willing to make a substantive commitment until we see something definitive coming out of Washington on the budget."The seemingly never-ending budget talks failed to produce an agreement yesterday. However, White House and congressional negotiators have said they are optimistic about reaching a compromise accord of roughly $30 billion before Friday, when across-the-board cuts are scheduled to go into effect under the Gramm-Rudman law."If we don't get a deficit reduction of $30 billion or more, it's not going to sit well with investors," contended Donald E.

    <TEXT>We've caught heck from the sages of Wall Street for suggesting over the past year that Fannie Mae was exposed to too much interest-rate risk. Well, all of a sudden a lot of investors seem to agree with us.They've been selling off the nation's largest mortgage buyer after Fannie disclosed last week that what it once called its "superior" risk management is coming undone. Fannie shares closed off nearly 3% on Friday, to $64.60, despite a rising overall market and the continuing housing boom, and are now trading at levels not seen in two years. Louisiana's Richard Baker, Congress's leading Fannie overseer, is concerned enough that he's now asked the company's regulator to deliver weekly reports on the mortgage giant's status.Specifically, Fannie reported last week that its duration gap -- a measure of how successful its interest-rate risk is hedged -- has been widening beyond its target range of plus-or-minus six months. In July, Fannie's duration gap was a negative nine months; in August it careened to 14 months, the largest ever reported. (A negative number reflects falling interest rates, a positive number reflects rising ones.)So what happened?The problem is clear: Falling interest rates have encouraged a record number of home refinancings and therefore of mortgage prepayments. In other words, Fannie's assets are being paid off faster than expected by homeowners.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TOKYO -- Astellas Pharma Inc. said Tuesday it has agreed to obtain non-public information from OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. in exchange for freezing its takeover attempt.Japan's second largest pharmaceutical company by sales said it agreed to OSI's standstill provision prohibiting any attempt to buy OSI shares through May 15, shortening the standstill period to six weeks from the two years OSI had originally wanted.The agreement keeps alive Astellas' hope to buy the U.S. cancer drug maker by allowing it to more accurately estimate OSI's value and make a fresh offer in as soon as six weeks. It also gives OSI more time to find a buyer willing to top the Japanese company's $52-a-share offer.OSI's new stance on the non-disclosure provision comes after a recent recommendation by the company's board to management. Extending its takeover attempt could improve Astellas' chances to successfully acquire OSI. Analysts didn't see $52 as an attractive offer, considering the recent OSI share price of around $59 on the Nasdaq stock market.With a more accurate evaluation of OSI and a fresh offer price, Astellas has a better chance of convincing OSI shareholders to tender their shares.</TEXT>

In 2000, the average Parker worker represented about $125,000 a year in sales. Today, that figure tops $200,000. "If I need to cut back, I have to cut back fewer people to achieve the same goal."Similar trims are taking place at each of Parker's nearly 300 factories. And to varying degrees, this is happening at thousands of other large and small factories across the U.S.</TEXT>

But lately they are starting to hear something new: praise."They are doing things better," says Craig Huss, vice president of transportation at Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the Decatur, Ill., grain-processing company.After years of service and merger-related problems, the Eastern railroad is taking a different course these days -- running a reliable railroad. Under Michael Ward, who became president of the railroad business CSX Transportation Inc. in 2000, CSX has cleared up its worst service problems and started winning over customers.While still trailing other railroads in overall efficiency, CSX is moving toward running its freight trains on a more precise schedule. It is trying to change the old adversarial railroad culture that created internal friction. And it is winning some freight business away from trucks and securing higher rates from customers for improved rail service."Customers were actually telling us the truth when they said if we gave them more consistent service, they would give us more business and pay us more," Mr. Ward says.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WHEATON, Md. -- In another sign of the harsh toll being exacted by the economic downturn, the number of Americans unemployed for six months or more has risen sharply over the past year and is likely to increase even more.The number of people unemployed for at least 26 weeks has risen to 1.6 million -- up 37% in the past year. That is almost double the percentage increase for the overall unemployed, according to a Labor Department report released Thursday. More than 18% of the unemployed have been looking for work for more than half a year, compared with about 11% at the start of the 2001 recession.If the economic downturn continues, "There's going to be greater pain hitting more people . . . than certainly happened in 2000," said Rebecca Blank, a Brookings Institution scholar who studies unemployment. One reason: A combination of long-term and short-term economic changes is making new jobs harder to find and employers more reluctant to hire.Almost every day, Tenille Barratsingh, a 28-year-old Silver Spring, Md., resident who lost her job as a senior bank teller in January, visits a crowded state-run employment-assistance center here in suburban Washington. Ms. Barratsingh, who spends hours at the center sending faxes and emails and checking Internet postings, figures she has applied for more than a thousand jobs."It's really frustrating to go through this phase when you wake up in the morning and you're like, 'I'm not going to work, I'm going to look for a job,'" she said.

    <TEXT>When it comes to the factors that influence electric-utility stocks, interest rates may be only half the story.Utility stocks have been in the dumps this year, mainly because rising interest rates make their dividends seem less attractive and increase their financing costs. But William F. Klausing, senior vice president of Irving Trust's public utilities division, argues that "interest rates are less important today than years ago in analyzing" utility stocks. "It's a whole new ballgame," he adds.Mr. Klausing's point, echoed by some analysts, is that, after many years of multibillion dollar construction programs, utilities no longer borrow large amounts to build new plants because such investments appear too risky politically. Hence, the expenses of utilities have become less sensitive to interest rates.To be sure, state regulators are trimming utilities' authorized rates of return -- and hence their profit potential -- in response to interest rate declines in the past few years. But, analysts note, many utilities have become units of holding companies. Profit from these publicly traded firms' non-regulated operations -- and from sales of electricity in the wholesale or bulk-power market -- have become important to a company's overall profitability.So what should the savvy investor look for in an electric-utility stock?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The publication of Josef Joffe's "The Myth of America's Decline" marks the latest skirmish in the war of words over declinism that has raged off and on since the early 1970s. Unlike Great Britain at the end of the 19th century, Mr. Joffe argues, the United States is still leagues ahead of its major competitors. Besides, generations of skeptics have gone broke betting against us.But anti-declinism easily shades over into complacency, a sentiment we cannot afford. Especially now, as the basis of our society, and of stable and decent political communities generally--a thriving and self-confident middle class--is eroding. Worse, either we don't know what to do about it, or we don't care enough to try.Getty Images Robert ReichIn 1971, according to the Pew Research Center, 61% of all adults lived in middle-income households. By 2011, the middle-income share had fallen to 51%, while the lower- and upper-income sectors grew. Median household income in 2011 was not significantly higher than it had been in 1989. Because upper-income households fared much better during those four decades, their share of total household income increased by 17 percentage points--to 46% from 29%--while the middle-income share fell by 17 points, to 45% from 62%. No wonder Neiman-Marcus and Wal-Mart are doing well while J.C. Penney and Sears are nearing collapse.These economic trends have social consequences. A recent study by Cornell University researcher Kendra Bischoff and Stanford's Sean Reardon finds that the share of families living in middle-income neighborhoods declined to 42% from 65% between 1970 and 2009. At the same time, the shares of families living in affluent neighborhoods and in poor neighborhoods more than doubled. Segregation along lines of income grew in each of the past decades, with the fastest growth coming between 2000 and 2009. This trend is not restricted to white Americans. In fact, segregation by income among black families grew four times as much as for whites, and Latino income segregation also increased more sharply.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>POLAND'S PLANSPolish Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz announced the new non-Communist government's preliminary plans to create a market economy, saying Poles will face tight money, bankruptcy and unemployment along the way.But he said Western countries are ready to help Poland and if the measures are put into effect, beneficial effects would be discernible in a year. He said the government would try to soften the pain of the program by introducing such measures as unemployment benefits.Previously exercised remedies such as price controls, ration coupons and centralized distribution would only worsen the problems and delay the cure, Mr. Balcerowicz said.After Mr. Balcerowicz's announcement, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa warned advisers that his movement -- and he personally -- could be blamed by angry Poles for the worsening situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON--Construction of new homes fell sharply in June, highlighting risks to the sector's recovery from rising mortgage rates and supply constraints.Housing starts declined 9.9% in June from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 836,000 units, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Building permits, a key measure of future construction activity, fell by 7.5%. The readings were much worse than expected, with most economists forecasting modest gains in both categories.But the decline in housing starts was primarily driven by a 26% drop in multifamily housing, a category that has traditionally been volatile and has lately shown signs of overbuilding. Starts for single-family homes, which account for the largest share of activity, fell by 0.8%. Single-family permits rose 0.1%."The outlook for housing is still bright," said Moody's Analytics economist Celia Chen. She said the June data "is more of a hiccup."The housing sector has been strengthening in recent months as low prices and steady employment gains have fueled stronger demand. The rebound has been providing key support to the U.S. economy, helping to offset public-sector budget cuts and a struggling manufacturing sector hit by weak overseas demand.</TEXT>

Yesterday's Heard on the Street column didn't specify which of Solectron's sources of funds contained the covenant.(WSJ Sept. 24, 2002)WHEN COMPANIES take big charges to earnings to write down "goodwill" they often urge investors to ignore the charges as mere accounting entries that don't affect their operating performance or financial stability. But bankers may not be so easily spun.Potential write-downs of goodwill assets by several big companies are looming -- and may place them in jeopardy of violating covenants on their borrowing agreements. By itself, this doesn't mean that any of these companies will be pushed into default on their debt. But it could give banks leverage to win concessions from the borrowers, such as higher interest rates and fees, the pledging of assets as security or agreements by the companies to pay off their loans sooner.</TEXT>

Yields fall as prices rise.The yield was little changed compared with 2.314% at the end of last week. It was 3% at the start of the year.Long-term inflation expectations fell to the lowest level since 2009, according to the Thomson-Reuters/University of Michigan November consumer sentiment survey released Friday. Meanwhile, a report from the Labor Department showed prices of imported goods fell 1.3% in October, the largest monthly decline in more than two years.Inflation chips away investors' fixed returns on bonds over time and is the main threat to long-dated bonds. Low inflation makes bonds more attractive to investors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Wall Street Journal OnlineThe Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here.In his first official act as a new prime minister, Kevin Rudd today signed paperwork that will lead to Australia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, further isolating the U.S. on climate issues just as negotiators are meeting in Bali to start work on Kyoto's successor.Mr. Rudd's signature would seem to bolster the United Nations- sponsored Bali conference's momentum, already building since the Nobel Peace Prize was co-awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its work documenting human-induced global warming. The latest scientific warning came just yesterday, in a study published by peer-review journal Nature Geoscience, which found the earth's tropical zones have begun to spread toward the poles. While some of the earliest signs of climate change came through melting ice in the Arctic, the study reports evidence of tropical expansion that could threaten subtropical societies. "Poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources," it says, but cautions that the implications still aren't well understood. And yet, despite the warnings and burgeoning political consensus, there's also little certainty about what the Bali talks will produce.While the U.S. delegation declared it won't be a "roadblock" to a new agreement, the Bush administration remains opposed to mandatory emission caps for greenhouse gases and some other steps many of U.S. allies support. China, which has seen billions of dollars in crops destroyed by the pollutants of its coal-burning power plants, and India, threatened by melting glaciers and devastating droughts, have both said they won't sign a treaty that slows their pace of economic development, as the Associated Press reports. Both countries are allowed to keep polluting under the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which itself has led to little actual reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. The product of much geopolitical wrangling, it required only 36 countries to limit pollution, and just over of third of those countries were former Soviet-bloc countries, the Los Angeles Times notes. The likes of Russia, Latvia and Romania have sharply lowered their carbon dioxide emissions since 1990, but that's more due to how the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union shut down smoke-belching factories, the Times says. And the Kyoto emissions were set far above the countries' actual emissions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Bush administration hopes to use the American backlash against job outsourcing to press India into concessions in other trade disputes, but New Delhi is resisting.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick challenged Indian officials to lower trade barriers as a strategy to help defuse the U.S. jobs-protection debate raging in Congress and American state capitals. To keep U.S markets open to India, New Delhi "has to open" its markets, he said.The U.S. wants India to reduce its agricultural and industrial tariffs and quotas, liberalize its government-procurement rules and stiffen its intellectual-property protection. These have been longtime U.S. goals, but the Bush administration is betting India might be more amenable to doing so if it will stave off American legislative proposals to limit the flow of U.S. jobs to India.Last year, trade between the two countries totaled $18 billion. India had an $8 billion trade surplus with the U.S. last year, a 50% increase from five years earlier.The Senate put more muscle behind Mr. Zoellick's warning Thursday, when it approved a measure that would impose restrictions on government contractors to discourage companies from outsourcing American jobs overseas. The ban wouldn't apply to countries that have signed an international accord liberalizing government-procurement rules, but India and China haven't signed that pact.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The persistent shortage of workers that has been crimping growth plans at many companies won't be ending anytime soon, according to Manpower Inc.'s latest survey of U.S. employers' hiring plans.Demand for employees is still growing, and with unemployment at its current extremely low levels, "the traditional labor supply is essentially exhausted," Manpower said.Companies pinched for labor may get a modicum of relief from recent legislative changes that eliminated Social Security earning limits; that freed some older workers from restrictions on their ability to work. But recruiting more workers "will continue to challenge employers throughout the country," Manpower said.Of the about 16,000 companies that participated in the survey, about 35% said they expect to be recruiting additional workers in the third quarter.That's the highest level seen in the 24 years that the survey has been conducted. During the year-earlier quarter, and again in the second quarter of the current year, the figure was an already very strong 32%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seasoned Eurodollar bonds ended 1/8 to 1/4 point lower Friday as the market focused on the dollar's continuing losses against many other major currencies.Traders said attention has turned to the currency markets after weeks of waiting for the U.S. Congress and the White House to negotiate proposals to cut the federal budget deficit. Trading was extremely thin after Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday closed U.S. markets. Dealers said they expect to see a bigger reaction to the dollar's fall when trading resumes today.The only new issue Friday was 10 billion yen ($74.4 million) of seven-year floating-rate notes for the Council of Europe Resettlement Fund, via LTCB International Ltd. The issue, paying 0.55 point under the Japanese long-term prime rate and priced at 100.20, was fully preplaced and isn't expected to trade.Belgium's decision to issue 55 billion yen of bonds last week signaled the attractiveness of Euroyen bonds, traders said. The issue was well absorbed by the market. More Euroyen issues are expected this week, a syndication official said.British government bonds, or gilts, ended 9/16 higher, in line with the British pound's rise. But with interest rates unlikely to fall in the near term, the market is expected to be lackluster over the next few weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While the U.S. economy is struggling, U.S. corporations aren't.A third of the way through the second-quarter reporting season, earnings at companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are the highest in four years, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt, who predicts the second half will be even stronger. Yet there is little indication that the strong results will jump-start the U.S. economy and get the millions of Americans idled by the recession back to work.About three-quarters of the companies that have reported so far have done better than analysts expected. Many of them -- ranging from manufacturers Honeywell International Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. to drug maker Abbott Laboratories -- raised their earnings forecasts for later in the year.Corporate profits -- one of the few areas of strength in the limp U.S. recovery -- appear to be weathering the economy's soft patch. But the gains in many cases have come from international operations, particularly in emerging markets."We aren't creating jobs," said Paul Huck, chief financial officer of Air Products & Chemicals Inc., on a conference call Friday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ten days after Katrina, the private economy is holding up nicely. Oil platforms and pipelines are being repaired, traffic is returning on the Mississippi, gasoline prices are stabilizing, and the stock market has rallied two days in a row. The biggest threat now to a rapid and complete recovery is the storm-after-the-storm in Washington, where the politicians are making Governor Blanco look composed.Our panicky, or shall we say opportunistic, solons are already using Katrina to bust through whatever spending limits they had previously set for themselves. Following last week's $10.5 billion, Congress is set to appropriate $52 billion more this week, and not just for the Gulf Coast. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has already tossed out $150 billion as a spending goal, and Republicans are saying they won't be outbid. No one wants to be stingy, but it's time to worry when the same people who passed a $286 billion highway bill without enough money for Louisiana levees now want to throw money at everything in sight.If you think we're being cynical, consider that it took all of two days back from recess for Democratic leaders yesterday to propose killing this year's budget resolution. That document is hardly a fiscal straitjacket. But it is the only mechanism Congress has for putting any restraint on Medicaid and other entitlements growing by 7% to 8% a year, or triple the inflation rate. It's a terrible sign for fiscal sanity that GOP leaders gave in yesterday and agreed to suspend "budget reconciliation" for at least two weeks.The real agenda here is to use Katrina to kill the Bush tax cuts and restore Congressional spending-at-will. The rules of "reconciliation" allow tax cuts to pass the Senate with 50 votes, rather than with the 60 needed to break a filibuster. So Republicans had hoped to use those rules to extend the Bush tax cuts on dividends and capital gains for another two years, through 2010. Without reconciliation, tax cuts are dead.The irony is that Congress is doing all of this just as the U.S. economy spurred by tax cuts is throwing off record increases in revenues. Federal coffers are rising this year to the tune of $262 billion more than in fiscal 2004, and most state budgets are also brimming. If America is going to have any hope of financing both a war on terror and hurricane relief, it needs to keep this expansion growing. Telling investors that their tax rates on dividends will soon rise back to 35% from 15%, and on capital gains to 20% from 15%, would both shock the stock market and hurt growth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The FX Global Call covers the main news events affecting foreign-exchange markets in Asian and European trading hours, as selected by DJ FX Trader editors in New York, London and Singapore, as well as other hot spots when warranted.1. Risk-off is the word(s) of the day, with investors selling stocks, emerging-market currencies, Italian bonds and more. A familiar hierarchy of safe havens is returning to the market, with the euro, Australian dollar and U.K. pound falling against the dollar, while the dollar sinks against the yen and Swiss franc. The selling started in Asia, but weak economic data out of the euro zone didn't help lift the mood.2. Emerging-market currencies are getting hit hardest, with the South African rand pushing further above 10 to the dollar and the Turkish lira sinking to 17-month lows. Investors have two reasons to sell today, as they worry that the U.S. recovery will lead to the Fed shutting down easing, and that slower growth elsewhere will weaken the finances of emerging economies. Steep losses in May could be just the beginning, with the plunging rand offering clues of what's to come, says Societe Generale's Kit Juckes. "As Fed policy reaches the mildest of turning points, emerging market assets are vulnerable across the board, the rand being the first of what I suspect will be a series of dominoes to fall over," he said.3. Even the yuan is falling, with many investors seeing reduced growth in China as the source of emerging markets' woes. While the government once again nudged its official exchange rate higher, investors are opting to push it lower. The yuan traded Friday at 6.1345 per dollar, from 6.1309 on Thursday, while the government fixed it at 6.1796, from 6.1820.4. Coming up in the U.S.:</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK--Reflecting its growing concerns about the global economic outlook, Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world's biggest bond fund, is dialing back exposure to riskier assets and moving to relatively high-quality investments.In the company's latest quarterly outlook, Saumil Parikh, a senior portfolio manager at Pimco and a member of the company's Investment Committee, said Pimco has been focused on cutting exposure to bonds sold by financial institutions in Europe, staying underweight in stocks in developed markets and reducing exposure to the foreign-exchange markets that have been whacked by heightened volatility this month.A main strategy over the next six to 12 months is to favor high-quality assets. Mr. Parikh said the company favors strong emerging-market debt, both corporates and sovereigns, as well as U.S. municipal bonds and U.S. agency and nonagency mortgages."Given our outlook for slow growth globally and recession in Europe, we are focusing on protecting portfolios against downside risk," Mr. Parikh said.Pimco investment professionals from around the world gather every quarter in Newport Beach, Calif., at the firm's headquarters to discuss the outlook for the global economy and financial markets.

    <TEXT>While the U.S. economy bounced back in the fourth quarter, Europe's own gross domestic product shrank for the first time since 1993, according to the chief European statistics agency. Still, evidence is mounting that a recovery on the Continent is under way.Among the 12 countries that share the euro, GDP, the total value of goods and services, contracted by 0.2% in the fourth quarter from the third, Eurostat reported. Growth was dragged down by corporate retrenchment in the face of slackening global demand. But just as it followed the U.S. in its downturn, Europe appears to be moving upward now as well.Surveys show that Europe's overall economic mood, as measured by the European Economic Sentiment Indicator, is now at its best since September, and inflation is on the whole falling. Spaniards are building. Italians are using more phone services and burning more electricity. The French keep buying. Lufthansa, the German airline, recently lifted a hiring freeze on cabin and ground crew as it prepares for more flights to the U.S. this summer. "Indicators increasingly point to improvements in economic conditions," Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, said last week.In its latest growth forecasts, the European Commission agreed. The European Union's executive body predicted yesterday that growth this quarter would be between 0.1% and 0.4%, from last quarter, and would improve further to 0.4% to 0.7% next quarter. "These forecasts confirm that the slowdown is over but suggest that the recovery will be moderate," the commission said in a statement.There is a wrinkle. The budding European economy is also unfolding at different rates in different countries. That isn't unusual for a large region, but part of the problem stems from the euro zone's very reason for being: Europe's common currency regime, which limits how much laggard countries such as Germany can spend to jump-start their economies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW DELHI--India's government said Tuesday it will launch a stimulus package to boost trade after data showed exports in November fell from a year earlier--the seventh consecutive month of on-year decline.The country's trade deficit narrowed to $19.3 billion in November from $21.0 billion in October, but it was up from the $15.8 billion reported a year earlier, and the government said it could fall short of its full-year export target.Exports for the month fell 4.17% from a year earlier to $22.3 billion, while imports rose 6.35% to $41.5 billion.Weak exports are worsening the slowdown in India, where the government faces intense domestic political pressure due to high inflation, a ballooning fiscal deficit and tight monetary policy. The economy grew 6.5% last fiscal year--the slowest pace in nearly a decade--and the rupee has weakened about 2.6% against the U.S. dollar so far in 2012, after a 16% fall in 2011.Trade Secretary S.R.

The year-earlier period included a benefit of $70 million, or roughly two cents a share, related to the resolution of a vendor dispute.The results put pressure on Schwab's stock, which has rallied this year. The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares fell 3.3% to $21 in 4 p.m. trading Tuesday but remain up 46% so far in 2013.While Schwab's earnings excluding the earlier gain rose 11%, investors focused on the per-share figure, which was a penny below Wall Street's average forecast of 19 cents. The shortfall came as Schwab missed its own forecast for curbing some quarterly expenses, such as employee pay. The company's expenses are still tracking above a new target it issued for such costs for 2013.In March, Schwab backed away from a planned spending push it outlined at the beginning of the year because trading volumes didn't rebound as the company had expected after the U.S. presidential election.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Call it Wall Street's other geopolitical driver, one played out not in Athens or Rome, but close to home in Washington.As stock-market investors fret over sovereign-debt contagion in Europe, a Nov. 23 deadline for the U.S. Congress's so-called budget supercommittee is fast approaching. The committee is assigned to devise at least $1.2 trillion in deficit-reduction measures over 10 years, or else automatic cuts ordained by Washington's summer debt-ceiling agreement are triggered.Friday's market action gave little hint that investors remain perturbed over Europe's debt situation, much less any happenings in Washington, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by triple digits. But the gains came on the kind of light volume that usually suggests a lack of participation.The outcome in Washington is a large unknown for the stock market, which is a creature vastly more wary of mystery than bad news. Bad news can at least can be analyzed and quantified. A large political unknown, by contrast, is all but sure to be a source of market volatility.The underlying fear is that lawmakers' cuts are too small to persuade credit-rating firms to maintain their current ratings on U.S. government debt. If that happens, stocks could engage in a replay of their plunge in August, which followed Standard & Poor's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. That action coincided with a surge of fears over Europe's sovereign-debt crisis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LOS ANGELES -- Over the past three years, Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. has worked hard to develop a marketing-driven approach to home building that it says will insulate it from the industry's notorious cycles.But investors, so far, aren't convinced.The big home builder last month posted its 17th consecutive quarterly earnings report that topped or matched analysts' expectations. Yet its stock sells for just seven times earnings that are expected to increase by 52% to $145 million, or $3.02 a diluted share, for the fiscal year ending next month. The stock closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $17.8125, up 6.25 cents and near a 52week low.Industry-wide, earnings multiples "are exceptionally low by historical standards," Merrill Lynch analyst Robert F. Curran says, "probably among the lowest ever." The reason: fears that another interest-rate increase is imminent, in a year when rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have already risen nearly a percentage point. Wall Street also frets about spot labor shortages and increasing land and construction-materials costs.Bruce Karatz, Kaufman & Broad's chief executive, finds this sentiment exasperating. "The market is saying 'the end is near,' and clearly doesn't give Kaufman & Broad Homes credit for changing its business model and mitigating cyclical risk," he complains.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said officials of the central bank are leaning toward lowering their targets for money-supply growth but haven't yet made the move because they haven't finished studying its implications.Mr. Greenspan, appearing before a House Banking subcommittee, said Fed policy makers recently discussed bringing the ranges down another notch "to conform to our long-term goal of price stability." He called the current ranges "still a fraction higher than they should be."But the Fed elected to delay such a step, Mr. Greenspan said, until it has a better grasp of the connection between current money-supply figures and the overall economy. "What we did not want to convey to the Congress is that we have some insight . . . that we do not have," he said.Asked by panel chairman Stephen Neal (D., N.C.) whether the Fed is "closing in on a better understanding," Mr. Greenspan answered, "Yes." Earlier, he said that the Fed's policy-setting committee would revisit the issue no later than its meeting next February.In the past, setting the targets has been a source of tension within the Fed. Hardcore inflation fighters want to lower the targets to underscore the central bank's commitment to bringing down inflation. But other Fed officials, including those who are more concerned about fostering short-term economic growth than further reducing inflation, have resisted.</TEXT>

That puts the average almost exactly at its previous record of 7085.16 on March 11, before a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase touched off a nearly 700-point, 9.8% pullback. The Dow industrials subsequently rallied more than 800 points, capped with a 143.29-point jump Monday to a record, driven by euphoria over a budget deal, tumbling bond yields and an expected capital-gains-tax cut.Yesterday, the market was threatened with having both props kicked out from under it. Poor bidding at a 10-year Treasury-note auction and troubling labor-cost data sent the 30-year bond price down 29/32, or $9.06 per $1,000 bond, driving its yield up to 6.96% from 6.89%.Then after the stock market closed yesterday, the heads of Congress's taxwriting committees set yesterday as the effective date of any capital-gains-tax cut enacted as part of the budget plan agreed to with President Clinton. That means the cut would apply to sales and exchanges occurring on or after May 7, 1997.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Brendan ConwayInvestors may be asking too much if they think the recent spate of deal making will be enough to finally ignite technology stocks.Hewlett-Packard launched a bidding war Monday to wrest data-storage company 3Par from Dell, but technology stocks largely failed to respond. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell Monday and technology stocks were among the Standard & Poor's 500-share index's worst performers.Macroeconomic worries appeared to drown out the boost that merger-and-acquisition activity provided Monday, at a time when technical analysts see the sector as primed for a rally off recent lows. The upshot may be that while M&A activity certainly provides a boost for stocks, it isn't necessarily the panacea that many investors had hoped for.Mergers certainly looked like a big boost last week. Technology stocks were showing encouraging signs last week amid efforts like Intel's $7.7 billion bid for McAfee Inc. The S&P 500's technology components started to turn around what had been a tough August, in which they were notable underperformers.</TEXT>

Thank goodness companies are in such spry shape.Thanks to the economic recovery that took hold last year, together with low interest rates and stringent cost controls, companies have more than repaired the heavy damage that hit their balance sheets at the start of the decade.

    <TEXT>BOSTON -- The Christian Science Monitor's editor, Katherine Fanning, resigned along with her two top assistants to protest a restructuring they say will weaken the paper.The restructuring will include staff cuts and other cost-reducing measures. It is aimed at narrowing the newspaper's losses at a time when the Christian Science Church, which owns the paper, faces financial strains from heavy outlays for a new television news program and a reduction in working funds because of the stock-market crash. A new format being considered for the Monitor would reduce the paper to 16 pages from its 28-page average, a church official said. The Monitor may also eliminate advertising.As part of the restructuring, Richard A. Nenneman, formerly general manager of print publishing for the Monitor, will become editor-in-chief in charge of all of the church's news operations, a new position. Richard J. Cattani, formerly the Monitor's editorial page editor, succeeds Ms. Fanning as editor.The Monitor's managing editor, David Anable, and assistant managing editor, David Winder, also resigned. In a letter to church leaders criticizing the restructuring plan, Mr. Anable said the plan calls for a 50% staff reduction and a "new desk-top, advertising-less version" of the Monitor that was presented to church leaders before the paper's editors had a chance to review it.Ms. Fanning, 61 years old, assumed her post at the Monitor in 1983 after serving as editor and publisher of the Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News, which she led to a Pulitzer Prize in 1976. While she was editor of the Monitor, its circulation rose to about 170,000 from about 150,000; it peaked at about 300,000 a few decades ago. She recently served as president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Isabel OrdonezHOUSTON--Exxon Mobil Corp. said Thursday its first-quarter earnings surged 69% as it benefited from high oil prices, stronger refining margins and a jump in natural-gas production. Other oil companies also reported soaring profits.The results for Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, reflected a continued recovery from the recession for the broader energy sector, which appears poised for a return toward the boom that preceded the 2008 financial collapse. But the robust earnings also coincide with sharp increases in gasoline prices, which have triggered concern among consumers and elected officials.Exxon's earnings jumped to $10.65 billion, or $2.14 a share, from $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a share, beating analysts expectations of $2.06 a share. The results were $4 billion shy of the record $14.8 billion it generated in the third quarter of 2008. Revenue rose 26% to $114 billion.Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. said profit jumped 46% to $1.55 billion, and Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell PLC posted profit of $6.29 billion, up 30%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Q. My husband and I own a co-op and have about $320,000 worth of equity. We're looking to buy a house in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn for $595,000. It's not a foreclosure, but it doesn't have a functioning kitchen or bathroom. (Nearby, a similar, smaller house in good condition is for sale for $879,000.)We think we can get the place for $475,000. Rehabbing it could cost as much as $400,000. But our real estate agent says that we'll have to pay all cash because no one will lend on a house in this condition. Is that true? We only have about $80,000 in cash, but our income and credit are excellent.New York CityA. Your real estate agent is mistaken; you do have financing options. Your best bet is an FHA 203k rehabilitation mortgage. It allows you to roll the purchase price, rehabilitation and closing costs, and even up to six months of mortgage payments (if you don't plan to live in the house during renovation) into one fixed- or adjustable-rate loan.However, you won't be able to borrow the entire $875,000 that you estimate it would take to buy and renovate this home. In Brooklyn, according to New York mortgage broker Melanie Crawford, FHA203k mortgages cover up to 96.5% financing of the purchase price and rehabilitation cost, to a base loan amount of $729,750. You can go higher than that if you install energy-efficient improvements, but cannot borrow more than 110% of either the value of the property plus the cost of rehab, or the appraised value of the property after rehab, whichever is less. You'd have to make up any shortfall. (For more rules on this program, see the Housing and Urban Development.)</TEXT>

Financial markets anticipate a slight increase in employment. Like government officials, voters have been turning cautiously optimistic, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows. By 39% to 23%, voters expect things to get better over the next year -- the highest level in a year."It's the second month in a row that there's been an uptick in the perception that things are getting better, and that's often a precursor of economic recovery," say pollsters Peter Hart and Vince Breglio, who conducted the survey.

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Last week's economic data provided a vexing picture of an economy in which industrial managers have slammed the brakes on production because of recession fears, but where inflation hasn't slowed as quickly as might be expected in a downturn.That combination means trouble for policy makers who want to jump-start the economy with lower interest rates, but worry that lower rates could also stimulate inflation.Industrial production in November plunged 1.7%, following decreases of 0.9% in October and 0.1% in September, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The November cutback was the biggest in a single month since production dropped 2% in January 1982.A 21.5% drop in auto and truck production, along with declines in other areas related to car manufacturing, accounted for more than half the loss in the month. Businesses also shut down a big chunk of productive capacity; industry operated at 80.9% of capacity in November, down from 82.4% in October. The November rate was the lowest since May 1987.In another report, the Labor Department said producer prices increased 0.5% in November, about twice what many economists had expected given recent statistics pointing to a clear economic downturn in October and November.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Expectations are running high on Wall Street that higher corporate profits will fuel a rise in stock prices that will keep them at record levels for many months to come.But some analysts warn that investors' expectations may be running too high, pumped up by wildly positive earnings results in the first quarter. They believe the stock market might be vulnerable to disappointments in the next few weeks, as second-quarter results are released, if the actual reports don't surpass expectations."It's hard to envision that earnings across the board will exceed the already high expectations that we are now seeing," says Jeffrey Applegate, an investment strategist with E.F. Hutton in New York.According to Institutional Brokers Estimate System, a service of Lynch Jones & Ryan that monitors Wall Street analysts' earnings estimates, upward revisions in estimates exceeded reductions during the month from mid-April to mid-May. That's the first time it's happened in nearly seven years, says Stan Levine of IBES. From mid-May to mid-June, upward and downward revisions were even.Another problem for the stock market is that the rate of earnings growth will decelerate significantly next year after peaking in the fourth quarter. Since stock prices tend to be a leading indicator, the stock market's advance could stall well before corporate profit growth slows, analysts caution.</TEXT>

E*Trade, which analysts say is trading like an Internet stock instead of a financial-services company, has seen its shares skyrocket 217% during the last three weeks.E*Trade said it had a loss of $13.2 million, or 23 cents a diluted share, compared with profit of $5.1 million, or 12 cents a share, for last year's fiscal first quarter. The Wall Street consensus estimate was for a first-quarter loss of 30 cents a share.Core transaction revenues, mainly stock commissions, increased 60% from last year and 40% from the last, sequential quarter as investors clamored for hot Internet stocks and other technology issues. "It's existing customers trading more . . . coupled with new customers coming online faster," E*Trade Chief Executive Christos Cotsakos said.But the flurry of trades couldn't make up for the $41 million E*Trade poured into marketing to promote its new Web site, analysts said.

    <TEXT>Robert A. Mundell, a Columbia University economist, won the Nobel economics prize yesterday. Following are excerpts from an article he published in the July-August 1990 issue of the Rivista di Politica Economica, an Italian economics journal. (Reprinted with permission.)Supply-side economics emerged as a political force partly as a reaction against the steep progressivity of personal and corporate income taxes and partly as a result of the breakdown of the international monetary system in 1971. The principal features of the supply-side program were a reform of the tax system, featuring a drastic slashing of marginal tax rates, and a reform of the international monetary system to one based on stable exchange rates anchored by gold or some alternative international asset.The United States had enacted high income tax rates after it entered World War I, and they were only gradually lowered, to a maximum rate of 25% under {Treasury} Secretary {Andrew} Mellon. But in June 1932, during the last year of the Hoover administration, marginal income tax rates were suddenly raised again to a maximum level of 60%. They remained at or (frequently) considerably above this level for half a century. The grand bargain entered into by both Democratic and Republican administrations up to 1981 was the exchange of punitive marginal income tax rates to satisfy the political left in exchange for sweeping tax loopholes to placate the political right.The collapse of monetary discipline with flexible exchange rates in 1973 and the subsequent oil embargo and increase in oil prices led to an inflation that further exacerbated the progressivity of the tax system. At the same time the absence of a stable monetary environment led to rising interest rates and exchange rate fluctuations that, almost arbitrarily, altered relative labor costs and international competitiveness. The exchange rate was determined increasingly by volatile international capital movements rather than the requirements of international trade. Reform of the international monetary system was therefore the second pillar in the platform of supply-side economics.Supply-side economics addressed itself directly to policy considerations rather than theoretical abstractions. It would be a mistake, however, to believe that it lacks any less of a scientific foundation than the older demand-side schools of monetarism and Keynesianism, or the new classical school. Its own academic credentials lie in the solid allocation-theoretic literature of neo-classical economics and the policy-oriented models of global monetarism and macroeconomics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fannie Mae has had to restate earnings covering the past several years, but the company's economist got his numbers right for this survey. Mr. Berson accurately predicted that the nation's gross domestic product -- the most widely used barometer of economic growth -- would be above the consensus expectation of 3.5% growth in the first quarter of 2005. His forecast was 3.9%; the government reported Wednesday that the actual figure was 3.8%. Mr. Berson also nailed his forecast for the change in the consumer-price index, which advanced 2.8% for the 12 months through May.Strong growth and inklings of inflation would normally lead to much higher yields on long-term Treasurys. But it didn't in the first half, and that is what really set Mr. Berson apart from other forecasters. The panel got walloped -- yet again -- by the bond market. The consensus among economists was that 10-year Treasury yields would rise from 4.2% in December to 4.8% by the end of June. But yields declined instead to 3.9%. Mr. Berson said they would rise to only 4.45%, making him less wrong than just about everyone else.Mr. Berson, who has worked at Fannie Mae for 17 years, is a baseball fanatic whose favorite number-cruncher is Bill James, a cult hero among baseball fans for his statistical abstracts of the nation's pastime. Mr. Berson said he will keep his first-half home run in perspective. "I'm constantly humbled by bad forecasts in both baseball and economics," he said.Right behind Mr. Berson was Lawrence Kudlow, the popular CNBC-TV commentator and head of the economic-consulting firm Kudlow & Co. He correctly predicted strong growth and a firmer dollar. Rounding out the top five were Mickey Levy of Bank of America Corp., Robert DiClemente of Citigroup Inc. and David Littmann, who retired from Comerica Inc. -- and our survey -- earlier this year.The least-accurate forecasts came from James Smith, a University of North Carolina business-school professor who predicted that falling oil prices would push the consumer-price index into negative territory; Bob Shrouds and Robert Fry, DuPont Co. economists who forecast a sharp economic slowdown; and Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, Ford Motor Co.'s chief economist, who predicted weaker growth and rising bond yields. Ironically, another person near the bottom -- David Rosenberg at Merrill Lynch & Co. -- had the best forecast for Treasurys. He said bond yields would drop to 3.8%. But Mr. Rosenberg, one of the more bearish economists on Wall Street, missed the boat by predicting weak growth and much tamer inflation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The job market recovery continues, sort of, though what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other. In Friday's Labor Department report for November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7.7% from 7.9% in October, but mainly because another 350,000 workers disappeared during the month.Call it the case of the missing workers. In the last year, employers have added an average of about 150,000 workers a month. In November they added 146,000, less 49,000 in downward revisions for the previous two months. Hiring grew at a healthy pace in professional services, leisure and hospitality, while falling slightly in construction and manufacturing.Yet even as payrolls are rising, albeit slowly, the overall labor participation rate has continued to fall. In November, the share of the available labor force that is working fell to 63.6%, which is down from 65.7% when the recession ended in June 2009.Mull that one over: Three years into an economic expansion, the labor participation rate has fallen two full percentage points and three times this year (including November) it has reached the lowest level since 1981. This means that about three million more workers were working or looking for work in 2009 than in November. In the last year alone, the number of working age nonworkers grew to 89.2 million from 86.8 million.So why are more Americans sitting on the labor market sidelines even as job opportunities expand? One popular suspect last month is Hurricane Sandy, yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded that the storm "did not substantially impact the national employment and unemployment estimates for November."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chesapeake Energy Corp.'s effort to reassure investors worried about its cash shortage backfired with bond investors who were rattled by the harsh terms of the $3 billion short-term loan the company detailed Monday.The price of the company's junk-rated bonds dropped sharply in heavy trading, as bondholders digested the steep interest rates on the new loan and the large funding gap that led Chesapeake to agree to it.Chesapeake's most-traded bond, due in 2020, fell 6% to 91.64 cents on the dollar, according to pricing service Benchmark Solutions. About $971 million of the oil-and-gas driller's debt changed hands, accounting for 26% of all high-yield bonds traded, according to MarketAxess.Concerns about the possibility of default rose -- the cost of insuring $10 million of Chesapeake bonds for one year against a potential default jumped by 36% to $727,000, according to Benchmark Solutions. Ratings agencies have assigned the company's debt double-B ratings, below investment grade, and last week Moody's Investors Service lowered the outlook to negative.The drop in bond prices contrasted sharply with a relief rally in the embattled Oklahoma City-based company's stock, which rose 4.7% to $15.50 as equity investors welcomed word of the new liquidity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The number of agricultural banks headed toward failure appears to have peaked, largely because of massive federal farm subsidies and other government help.But while the number of imperiled farm banks has declined in recent quarters, economists, bankers and bank regulators say they don't expect any substantial improvement in the agricultural economy soon.Indeed, should the government pare its huge support package for farmers and their lenders -- including subsidies, regulator forbearance for troubled banks, and holding farm land off the market -- agriculture could head into another tailspin. "The government programs, in a number of ways, are serving to stablize conditions," said Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.Federal subsidies are expected to account this year for nearly three-fourths of farmers' incomes nationwide, which Mr. Drabenstott estimates at about $35 billion.That infusion of money is helping many farmers and, thus, lenders hang on. According to the latest Federal Reserve Board data compiled by Veribanc Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consulting concern, the number of farm banks likely to fail has been declining since a year ago.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Plenty of dark clouds loom over the U.S. job market -- particularly the potential double-punch of tax increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff.But if the U.S. can avert that Washington-made crisis, the outlook for workers finding jobs is actually looking pretty good for next year. For one thing, the damage of superstorm Sandy will have to be repaired, meaning jobs in construction and retail. Businesses, meanwhile, which have held off investing and hiring because of uncertainty over the fiscal outlook, might finally open their wallets. That means more jobs, too.Employers have stepped up their hiring recently, adding 171,000 jobs in October and an average of 157,000 a month so far this year. That's a better pace than last year and the strongest job growth since 2006, Labor Department data show.Of course, the recovery of the job market has been, and probably will remain, incremental. Job growth needs to be much stronger to actually make a big dent in unemployment, which remains high at 7.9%, though down from 10% three years ago.The government's next snapshot of the job market, due Friday, will be distorted by Sandy, which devastated the Northeast in late October, leaving many jobless. Economists say Sandy could temporarily knock anywhere from 100,000 to 150,000 off of the government's jobs tally for November, resulting in job growth of under 100,000 or even much less.</TEXT>
