    <TEXT>I am sick of everyone blaming the breakdown in the credit and housing markets on subprime loans. Subprime loans were certainly part of the problem, but they are a symptom of a deeper issue. What's happening in the market today is not the bursting of a five-year bubble but the bursting of a 40-year bubble and the failure of the mortgage loan system to meet the needs of the marketplace.The truth is that subprime lenders, by responding to demand, were the finger in the dike for the whole housing market. The real problem is affordability and the incongruity between incomes and home pricing.Forty years ago, the median national price of a house was about twice the median household income. In some parts of the country, this ratio was closer to 1 to 1. Twenty years ago, the median home price was about three times income. In the past 10 years, it jumped to four times income.But in most major economic centers, typical families haven't been able to buy a home for anything near the national median price for decades. Try to find a single-family home in the D.C. area for the national median of $221,900. In the major markets, there is tremendous dependency on alternatives to the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which in turn has created a dependency on the least scrupulous mortgage companies and lenders.The issue of affordability is not news to the major players in real estate. Each month, lenders, developers and government agencies study the National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index. This index provides a way to track whether housing is becoming more or less affordable for typical households nationwide; it incorporates changes in key variables such as home prices, interest rates and incomes.</TEXT>

A concise summary of his reflections on monetary policy and related problems is contained in the following draft of his notes prepared for a final press conference held last week, and reproduced here with ids permission.) 1)	What can I say after 7 years on The Fed except that it was a great and 1 think creative experience. One question frequently asked is: Mas there been any unexpected or basic change in how economy operates in past 7 years?۝ I don۪t think so. In 1955, I wrote a book on analyzing economy and forecasting. I think model contained in that would cover almost all liiat iias happened. There would be some important changes in emphasis and details, but off-hand 1 can think of no major change in concepts, theories or even approach.(a)	There has been no major financial crisis. No major financial institutions	failedalthough	speculation probably was as great as in past periods when they did. Expansion of national output was longer and greater than in any prior expansion. Depth of recession smallerand it was planned. The basic knowledge means we can avoid major depressions. In 1966 and 1970, there were questions as towhether Fed could avoid a crunch۝ by performing as lender of last resort. T assumed Fed would be sensible and it was. Note though this limits tightness of monetary policy compared to what some would advocate. (b)	On the other hand, better knowledge and communication probably means increased basic instability in private sector and particularly in financial markets. Expectations (or speculation) spread faster. People react more rapidly and strongly in the spheres of prices, wages, investments. This raises major problems for policy change.(c)	We want to operate within that zone of the trade-off curve of output and priceswhere required policy moves go beyond bounds of our information or knowledge. We cannot fine tune to extent wc would like because we are operating within random variance of data and knowledge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At the Buster Brown children's clothing factory in Coeburn, Va., manager Joe Gillespie speaks the sort of language unheard for years in the coal fields counties of Southwest Virginia: "We've hired 60 people in the last two months and we plan on hiring another 60 in the next few months."Almost unnoticed, the economy of the chronically depressed counties along the Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia borders has begun to stir for the first time since a worldwide boom in coal peaked in 1982.Shopping centers are under construction in St. Paul and Norton. Outside Lebanon, Mattaco Inc. has put 65 people to work making parts for automobile cruise-control mechanisms destined for new Fords, a figure that will rise to 150 as soon as the company can get additional production machinery up and running.Meanwhile, since the region's rugged landscape makes it hard to find enough flat land for a house, much less a factory site, a remote mountaintop is being leveled in Buchanan County to accommodate a new $32 million state prison that eventually will provide about 350 new jobs and an annual payroll of $7 million.The new prison, which was ordered put in Buchanan County by Gov. Gerald L. Baliles precisely to give the area an economic boost, is the largest, but not the only, evidence of a determination in Richmond to try to help the coal fields counties begin to catch up with the economic success of the rest of the state.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interest rates are on the rise again, and that's bad news all around. Major commercial banks raised the prime rate for the fourth time this year to 10.5 percent, highest in almost four years. And we may not be at the end of the cycle.Higher bank interest rates have been expected in the wake of what banks claim have been their own rising costs of money. But there could be an element of greed, too, as banks try to make up for losses on Third World loans.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board is keeping an eagle eye on the recent slide of the dollar. A depreciated dollar helps exports, but it has two negative aspects: it threatens new inflation stemming from the higher cost of imported goods, and it also can discourage the flow of foreign investment necessary to finance the national budget deficit. The Fed is walking a tightrope between the desirability of low interest rates to spur domestic expansion and higher interest rates to prop up the dollar.Unless he gets help on the deficit-control side from fiscal policy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan plainly warned in recent testimony, he may have no choice but to opt for higher interest rates.That could choke off an already tiring, six-year domestic expansion and confront the Bush administration with sudden recession. Higher interest rates would also compound massive problems in the battered savings and loan industry, already losing $1 billion every month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK, May 34 UP)The stock market resumed its spring uptrend this week and approached closely its 1958 high.The Associated Press averages of 60 stocks rose $2 to $169.60, just a whisker beneath its year۪s peak of S169.90.Only one week of declining prices separated this past week from a series of five straight weekly advances. Strength by steels and aircrafts was a featui'e of the week. Utilities edged ahead to a new ۪58 high of their own.The higher-priced issues came back into their own, giving the market a more solid character. In the prior week cheaper stocks were running with the ball. Some, of these came to the fore this week again but they did not take away the spotlight.Tobaccos were upset late in the week by another health scare. This encountered a denial and the tobacco shares recovered a bit but their rebound was weak considering the sharp losses they sustained.</TEXT>
