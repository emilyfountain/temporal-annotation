    <TEXT>It appears no fewer than four times on the top 10 list of best- selling funds for early 2005: Capital Income Builder, Capital World Growth & Income, Income Fund of America and the Franklin Income Fund. By comparison, "growth" shows up only three times and "global" just once.Those four income funds together took in 20 cents of every dollar that went into all stock and bond funds in January and February, by my calculation using figures from the consulting firm Financial Research Corp. in Boston.The investing public and their advisers, it appears, have embraced income funds as the great anti-speculation, a remedy for the excesses of the last great bull market. As an extra kicker, U.S. rules now give most dividends the same lower income tax rates accorded long-term capital gains.The idea seems sound enough. The question is, could success spoil this pretty picture? Is everybody on guard against the danger of increased risk that tends to infiltrate any category of investments enjoying a hot streak? "We have great respect for dividend-paying ability as an indicator of quality," says Tom McManus, chief investment strategist in New York at Banc of America Securities LLC. "But today's investor seems to be chasing high current income without regard for growth or safety."When you look at the recent performance of some of these funds, their popularity is no mystery. According to Bloomberg data, the $32.3 billion Franklin Income Fund averaged an 11.3 percent annual return over five years through the end of March, a period in which the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted a loss of 3.2 percent a year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congress will appropriate more than $1 trillion this year, and all the Congressional Black Caucus wants is $1.3 billion. But after six months of haggling over the funding for a youth jobs program, the group is running out of time.The 42-member CBC has pushed for months for Congress to extend funding for a youth summer jobs initiative that was created in last year's economic stimulus bill. Similar to a program in the District, the initiative gives localities money to hire young people ages 14 to 24 for clerical work, construction and other entry-level jobs that last six to eight weeks.The funding is not specifically allocated based on race, but localities are encouraged to offer jobs to youths who are "most in need," such as high school dropouts and children whose parents are incarcerated -- groups that are disproportionately African American. The CBC hopes the funding will provide for about 300,000 jobs.The failure to secure the money illustrates a broader challenge for the CBC. In the midst of the recession, black lawmakers and civil rights advocates have called for specific policies to aid African Americans and other low-income people. Their argument is twofold: At 16 percent, the unemployment rate among blacks is higher than for other groups, and the increase in federal spending to ease the recession could help address persistent unemployment and other long-standing problems for blacks and low-income people.Rather than focus their efforts on President Obama, who has expressed reluctance to target funds for blacks or any other group, the CBC has tried to push measures through Congress. But as deficit concerns rise in both parties, the black lawmakers have had little success.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like the rest of the stock market, shares of Giant Food Inc. fell yesterday, declining 9 percent after Tuesday۪s release of financial data that showed slightly lower fourth- period profit despite higher period sales at the grocery chain.The Landover-based company, which is the dominant food retailer in the Washington area, saw its shares decline $2.37'/i after heavy trading yesterday to close at $22.87۪/! on the American Stock Exchange.The drop, according to many analysts who follow Giant, came because of disappointment with the fourth- period earnings, which they had expected to rise rather than fall.Considering the 4.2 percent rise in sales for the period that should have boosted profits, analysts said they were worried that Giant was not cutting costs fast enough to keep up with the lower prices the retailer has needed to offer customers in an increasingly competitive market."I think they are still facing the problems of tougher competition in their market area. Their costs are a bit out of control to deal with the lower prices and that is pressuring their result,۝ said Kurt Funderburg of the brokerage Ferris, Baker Watts Inc. in Baltimore. But they need those lower prices to maintain market share.۝</TEXT>

Well, can you still remember where you and your cronies sneaked away to imbibe? Today۪s teenagers possess little more imagination. Behind the bleachers, deserted country lanes and cemetery parking lots still can supply a pretty good haul of empty aluminum beer cans. In one day of searching, my daughter and I gathered enough cans to treat the family to a meal under the golden arches.

    <TEXT>The recent turmoil on Wall Street reflects the simple fact that interest rates are rising rather than falling for the first time in nearly a decade, forcing speculators and investors to recalibrate the assumptions onBut the consensus among economists is that the rise in rates will not choke off the current expansion because1 the economy is strong enough to overcome it."IkTear term, these higher interest rates and market gyrations are scary for everyone,۝ said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Lehman Brothers Inc. But in point of fact, the amount of damage to the economy should not be great.۝The rate of growth in the economy is determined by a number of factors, including incomes, exports, jobs,۝ said Gordon Richards, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers. "And right now those factors are providing the econo-, my with enough momentum." This calm in the face of rising rates may seem somewhat at odds with recent economic history. Last year, after all, falling interest rates were widely credited with getting the economy out of low gear. Wouldn۪t a rise in rates now have the opposite effect?Not exactly, say economists. How much a rise in interest rates will hurt the economy depends in large part on what is causing it. And in this case, the cause is likely to be benign.</TEXT>
