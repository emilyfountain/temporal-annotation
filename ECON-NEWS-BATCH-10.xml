    <TEXT>There's good news and bad news for the Reagan administration in the poverty statistics for 1984, published Tuesday by the Census Bureau.The good news is that after increasing steadily during the administration's first three years until the number of poor reached a post-1965 high, poverty has begun to decline. The economic recovery of 1983-84 brought greater prosperity to many of the poor as well as to most everyone else. As a result, about 1.8 million people moved above the poverty line. Moreover, the improvement was broad-based, with the black poor in particular showing significant gains. At least for the time being, this accomplishment should quiet those who have criticized "Reaganomics" as unfair to the less well-off.The bad news is that even after a period of robust economic growth, the Reagan administration so far still has wound up with more people in poverty than at any time since 1966 (except, of course, for its own time in office). The nearly one-percentage-point reduction last year -- from 15.3% to 14.4% of the population -- is nothing to sneeze at. However, it's not unprecedented and is just about the same amount by which the poverty rolls had been rising annually. More improvement may yet come, but it will be increasingly difficult.The reason is that many of the remaining poor fall into groups that have typically had above-average rates of poverty. In 1984, 35% lived in female-headed households; 10% were elderly; 20% fell into the category of "unrelated individuals," which includes widows living alone, lodgers and others without close ties to the rest of society.These people are not unaffected by economic conditions. To the contrary, economic growth means increased earnings for those who work or higher welfare benefits for those, like the elderly, who do not. During 1984, the Census Bureau reported better incomes for each group.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Senate Republican leadership drafted a revised budget plan that would eliminate any cost-of-living increase for Social Security beneficiaries next year and hold growth in fiscal 1986 defense spending to the rate of inflation.President Reagan endorsed the lower military figures in an effort to win passage of the total package. Most of the increased savings from the Pentagon would be used to restore proposed cuts in domestic programs.Though relatively small in 1986, the deeper savings from the president's proposed defense budget would amount to $17.7 billion over the next three years when compared with an earlier leadership compromise allowing 3% growth after inflation. Only last week, Mr. Reagan criticized the Senate for being "irresponsible" when it rejected the higher military figures. In accepting the revised budget package, the administration has agreed to more than $21 billion in reductions from its initial spending request for fiscal 1986, which starts Oct. 1, and more than $115 billion in the next three years.The GOP leadership, scrambling to win needed votes, backed away from terminating such sensitive items as Amtrak subsidies, the Job Corps, the Small Business Administration, mass transit operating assistance and "impact" education aid for public school districts affected by federal installations. More than $5 billion was restored to student aid and federal health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and proposed agriculture savings were reduced in an effort to appease farm-state senators.Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D., Neb.) was expected to vote with the Republicans after winning what he estimated were $2.5 billion in restorations for farm programs, and a White House aide predicted narrow victory for the budget package. "We ought to be all right, exactly all right," the aide said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>CHICAGO -- FMC Corp. said its proposed $1.8 billion recapitalization won't require the big chemical and defense products concern to sell additional assets.However, FMC officials conceded that its forecast could be altered by the huge debt load the company is taking on to finance the plan, higher interest rates, lower commodity prices or problems with its defense business. Some analysts have questioned the post-recapitalization earnings outlook, calling it overly optimistic.Moreover, because of the big borrowings, FMC would have a negative net worth of about $627.7 million at the end of this year under the plan. And the company projects that its net worth wouldn't be positive again until 1991. Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the plan May 22.In its proxy material, FMC said it received commitments from a group of banks led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York to raise about $1.4 billion for the plan. FMC said it also expects to raise $625 million from the sale of subordinated debentures.The company disclosed in the proxy material that it expects to pay $60 million in bank, investment banking, legal, accounting and other fees in connection with the transaction -- one of the highest figures ever in a corporate restructuring.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- A dive in orders for big-ticket factory goods in March erased hopes that the recession will end for manufacturing in the next month or two.Orders to manufacturers for durable goods -- items intended to last more than three years, such as cars, appliances or heavy machinery -- sank 6.2% in March to the lowest level since August 1987, the Commerce Department reported. The drop, the third in a row, followed declines of 0.2% in February and 2.0% in January, and left orders 15.4% below a year earlier."Today's orders are tomorrow's production," said Stuart Hoffman, economist with PNC Financial Corp., a Pittsburgh bank holding company. "So I think this signals that production and jobs {in manufacturing} will be down in the second quarter."The majority of economists believe the economy will turn around and grow slightly in the second period, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a survey of business economists and consulting groups. And some sectors of the economy, such as housing, have shown signs of bottoming out. But the durable-goods report was strong evidence for those who believe that the recovery may be a few months further down the road and that growth won't restart until the third quarter."This puts to rest the notion that with the end of the war came the end of the recession," said Nancy Sidhu, an economist with Security Pacific National Bank. Ms. Sidhu pointed in particular to a 10.3% slide in orders for nondefense capital goods, closely watched as a barometer of the industrial sector's investment and production plans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Target-date funds, which suffered a black eye in the market crash, are looking better these days.During the bear market of 2007-09, target-date funds designed for investors retiring in 2010 lost about 37% on average, according to Morningstar Inc., blindsiding some soon-to-be-retirees. These funds were taken to task by government officials, lawmakers and investors for what some said were overly aggressive allocations to stocks and for failing to clearly explain their strategies and risks."Some investors didn't realize they could lose money," says Robyn Credico, a senior consultant at employee-benefit consulting firm Towers Watson.The stock market's rebound from its early-2009 low has propelled most of these funds back into positive territory, even for some investors who bought at the market's 2007 high, prompting some in the industry to say concerns about the funds' asset allocations were overdone.Despite the improved performance and the fact that some fund providers have taken steps to reduce volatility in their portfolios, some industry watchers say target-date products may still be too risky for those in or near retirement.</TEXT>
