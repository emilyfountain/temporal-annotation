    <TEXT>The Wall Street Journal OnlineThe Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here.On Friday evening, with Congress out of town on its summer recess and Americans heading into a mid-August weekend, the Bush administration sent a message to the states: The federal government will make it tougher for a national children's insurance program to cover the offspring of middle-income families.The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in 1997 to help children whose families couldn't afford insurance but didn't qualify for Medicaid, and administration officials tell the New York Times that the changes are aimed at returning the program to its low- income focus and assuring it didn't become a replacement for private insurance. Administration point man Dennis Smith wrote to state officials saying there would be new restrictions on the District of Columbia and the 18 states -- including California and New York -- that extend or plan to extend coverage for children whose families make more than 250% of Federal poverty levels. For a family of three that 250% is $42,900, and for a family of four it's $51,625. Under the new limits, a child from a family making more would have to spend one year uninsured before qualifying, and any state that wants to extend coverage would have to assure Washington that at least 95% of children eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid are enrolled in one of the programs. But as the Associated Press reports, no state can currently make such assurances.Rachel Klein, deputy director of health policy for advocacy group Families USA, tells the AP that since many families above the 250% threshold can't afford private insurance, "the effect of this policy is to have more uninsured kids." Ann Clemency Kohler, deputy commissioner of human services in New Jersey, tells the Times the changes "will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children." States have already been imposing waiting periods and taking other steps to prevent parents from moving their children from private insurance to SCHIP, which currently serves some 6.6 million children, the Washington Post notes. The administration's new restrictions come as the program, which expires at the end of next month if Congress doesn't reauthorize it, is the subject of a larger political fight that pits the White House against Democrats and some Republicans in Congress and state capitals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Indecision marked the dollar's tone, as traders paused for breath, awaiting a critical monthly U.S. employment report for release today.The dollar ended the New York day slightly weaker against both the euro and the yen.Market participants were also reluctant to make major bets on the yen, following a stream of more rigorous-sounding statements from top Japanese officials about the issue of bank reforms.Late yesterday afternoon in New York, the euro was at 98.77 cents, slightly stronger than its 98.68-cent level late Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at 122.59 yen, down modestly from 122.84 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.4782 francs, unchanged, while sterling was changing hands at $1.5698, up from $1.5689.The euro managed to raise its head briefly above 99 cents during New York trade, for the first time in roughly four weeks, taking advantage of some softness in stock markets and some worries about the state of the U.S. economic recovery ahead of the employment report.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Many people think that the monster of health-care inflation has been licked or at least driven back into its cave. As early as July 1984, for example, then Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler proclaimed that the Reagan administration had "broken {its} back." This assessment seems to be widely shared within the business community. And this July, headlines announced that "spending on health care in 1985 rose at the lowest level in two decades." Unfortunately, rumors about the defeat of the "health-care monster" may be vastly exaggerated.How did the health-care cost spiral start? During the 1960s and 1970s the American people implicitly signed a social contract with the nation's providers of health services that was so open-ended as to be almost incredible. Under this contract, the providers would be left alone to determine how best to treat the illnesses of their patients. As compensation they were issued keys to sundry health-insurance treasuries, there to recoup whatever auditable costs they had incurred (if they were hospitals) or to fetch whatever fees they deemed "usual, customary and reasonable" (if they were physicians). Only very mild and generally ineffective limits were ever placed on the sums taken by individual physicians or hospitals from these insurance treasuries. Not surprisingly, prices varied widely and often capriciously among providers, and overall outlays on health care climbed.This benificent contract was written at a time when most experts thought the nation was short of both doctors and hospital beds, so that health-care providers largely dictated the terms of the contract. Inevitably, however, the very generosity of the deal drew into the medical profession legions of educated baby-boomers eager to do well by doing good. By the late 1970s, an erstwhile sellers' market had thus transformed itself into a buyers' market with surplus capacity all around.More than two-thirds of all health services or products are paid at point of service, not by the patient, but by some third party -- either a private insurance carrier or the public sector. As early as the late 1970s, these third-party payers began attempting to control escalating health-care costs. After Ronald Reagan's election in 1980, a two-pronged attack was made upon the health-cost monster.The first came from the business community, which pays for about a third of all health-care expenditures through employer-paid health-insurance premiums. It sought to control the rise in its premiums by forcing employees to share a greater proportion of their health-care bills at point of consumption, and by encouraging them to join so-called Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) or Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Under a PPO a business firm (and/or its insurance carrier) seeks price concessions from a limited set of doctors and hospitals who render care on a fee-for-service basis. In return for these price concessions, the firm offers its employees financial inducements to seek health care only from providers within the PPO network. Under the HMO contract, a network of physicians and hospitals contracts to provide a firm's employees all necessary health care in return for a flat, prepaid annual fee. The HMO thus has every incentive to minimize the costs of treating patients.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Wall Street Journal OnlineA LATE POP by General Motors kept the Dow Jones Industrial Average from sinking into negative territory for 2005.Drifting lower all day, the blue-chip average briefly dipped into the red for the year. But a last-minute surge by GM, one of 30 Dow industrial stocks, helped the average trim its losses just before the close. The auto maker's stock gained 2.9% thanks to a report that it is considering giving a board seat to Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp., which has been buying GM shares and advocating a corporate makeover to invigorate the stock.Analysts said the overall decline by stocks was a carry-over from a selloff that began in late trading Tuesday, when investors unloaded stocks after a big rally. The Dow finished yesterday down 45.95 points at 10810.91, leaving it up just 0.26% for the year.The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.33 points to 1257.37, leaving it up 3.75% for the year, and the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 8.75 points to 2252.01, up 3.52% year-to-date. Treasury-bond prices declined ahead of a 10-year Treasury-note auction today, pushing yields higher. The dollar, which has benefited from rising interest rates in the U.S. and stagnant rates elsewhere, advanced against the euro and yen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Commercial and industrial loan volume in the U.S. is expected to grow a brisk 9.2% next year to $349 billion, according to a forecast by Loan Pricing Corp.The projected increase is surprising, since it is higher than forecasts for growth in the nation's Gross National Product next year and greater than commercial loan growth in any of the prior four years. In 1988, commercial loan volume grew 7.2%, and estimates are that it will grow 7.6% this year.Richard Bennett, senior economist for Loan Pricing, said, "People are going to need credit. We believe the economy has still got another year of growth in it."Loan Pricing, a private firm that sells data on the commercial loan market, cited higher interest rates on junk bonds as one factor that is causing more borrowers to turn to short-term bank loans. The well-publicized troubles of some large issuers of high-yield corporate bonds have sent interest rates for such issues climbing to new highs relative to government debt.Mr. Bennett said, "{Junk} bonds are becoming less and less of a way of financing."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OTAVALO, Ecuador -- The long black braid, the blinding white cotton trousers and the woven shoes of the local businessmen here are visible reminders of this community's tenacious cultural pride. But it is at the markets, brimming with traditionally designed wool sweaters, bags, hammocks and wall hangings -- all crafted on imported looms -- that the Otavaleno's much-touted entrepreneurial savvy is on display. Behind the walls of many humble homes in this town, substantial inventories of those same products are bound for markets in Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Europe and the U.S.Located two hours north of Quito by car, on a winding and rutty road, this is said to be the only indigenous community -- of about 40 -- in the country never to have been brought under the control of the Spanish conquistadors. Ergo, instead of the stereotypical Indian poverty and isolation, the dignified Otavaleno is renowned for his independence and worldliness.There is one thing, however, that Otavalenos share with this country's other Indian groups, mestizos and Europeans: profound economic suffering at the hands of the perniciously politicized Ecuadoran central bank. Since August 1998 the country's currency, known as the sucre, has lost 80% of its value in dollar terms, destroying savings and living standards; 1999 gross domestic product contracted 26.6% in dollar terms. Inflation, which in 1999 was more than 60%, is forecast to reach 90% in 2000.Things are so bad here that even Ecuador's politicians, notorious fans of the central bank as an inexhaustible source of generosity, have caught on. This explains how it is that on Tuesday the Ecuadoran Congress narrowly passed a law mandating that within 180 days the central bank's dollar reserves will be used to retire the paper sucres currently in circulation -- at a rate of 25,000 to one. The new law marks the end of the central bank's power to print money and the beginning of economic hope for 12 million Ecuadorans.Yet, it is still only hope. The law grossly perverts the term dollarization in order to preserve specific discretionary central-bank powers such as setting reserve requirements and interest rates and the ability to intervene in the markets through the use of repurchase agreements. The central bankers, it would seem, harbor a deep-seated desire to manipulate monetary outcomes even in the absence of a domestic currency system. This is absurd, but it is also illustrative in that it dramatically defines the core problems of the country: The central bankers, along with this country's other privileged elite, are dug in so hard that nonsense becomes law at their behest. Prying their hands off the economy and moving toward liberalization will mean a long, hard fight, well beyond the simple dollar-for-sucres exchange.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The outlook for business investment appears to be improving, but business spending is still likely to be weak through the end of this year.The G7 Group Inc., a closely held political and economic consulting firm, said the latest preliminary reading of its quarterly index of business investment improved to a minus 25 in the fourth quarter from minus 37 in the third quarter.An index measure of minus 33 or lower suggests that business fixed investment is contracting in the current quarter. An index reading between zero and minus 33 indicates growth, but at slower rates than the historical average of 5%. Results greater than zero indicate above-average business investment.More specifically, the minus 25 reading is consistent with a 1.1% increase in business investment in the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, G7 Group said.If business investment does grow at a 1.1% annual rate this quarter, it would be a step up from the third quarter, when capital spending increased at a 0.6% annual rate, the first gain in two years. But it is also well below the robust levels of the late 1990s, and weak enough to keep pressure on consumers to continue spending to keep the economy afloat -- a tall order given that many economists believe the approaching holiday season will be a disappointment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Venture capitalists never know for sure which energy innovations will succeed, but they've learned a lot about what it takes to give them a chance. The Wall Street Journal's Kimberley A. Strassel discussed the makings of a successful venture with Ray Lane, managing partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Matthew Rogers, a McKinsey & Co. director and former senior adviser to the secretary of energy for Recovery Act implementation.Here are edited excerpts of their conversation.MS. STRASSEL: People have come to understand over the past year or two that sometimes energy projects are incredibly capital-intensive, a billion dollars sometimes to create a plant, and sometimes it's going to take seven or eight or years to build one of those. How does a venture-capital market evaluate the risk of that, and do they have the patience and time to do those kinds of investments?MR. ROGERS: You're going to have to think through how you deal with existing infrastructure, because you're going to try and displace it in a finite market. You're going to have to understand where all the capital is going to come from during the life cycle, because otherwise it doesn't make sense for a venture capitalist. The idea is to take a lot of risk in an early stage and hope you have enough ownership and liquidity to get a 10X return, because you're going to have a lot of losers in the portfolio.MS. STRASSEL: Can venture capital do this alone, though?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DETROIT -- The city of Detroit plans to close 77 public parks as part of a bid by Mayor Dave Bing to cuts costs due to a budget deficit pegged at hundreds of millions of dollars.Roughly 1,400 acres of parkland will be affected by the closures, which are scheduled to take place July 1."Basically, this was how can we close the lowest number of places," said Dan Lijana, spokesman for the mayor. "Some of these are the largest, most sprawling parks in the city, and some of the most scenic."Mr. Bing pledged more fiscal responsibility when he took office in May 2009, and has been pushing for cuts citywide to stave off financial insolvency. He has won concessions from just over half the city's public-sector unions but he hasn't seen eye-to-eye with the city council, which has pushed for even deeper cuts than he is proposing.Detroit has closed dozens of schools in recent years and cut back on other city services, such as busing, as the city as a whole has begun to respond to a decline in population that has left whole blocks and neighborhoods sparsely populated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- A prominent longtime bear on gold is turning bullish.Gold hasn't appealed to many investors lately in the current low-inflation climate. The metal is trading at less than half its 1980 highs, and its 9% price gains since New Year's have been dwarfed by rallies in the stock and credit markets. "Gold just sits there" in comparison with other investments, says William O'Neill, research director at Rudolf Wolff Futures Inc., New York.Nevertheless, after two years of bearish price forecasts on gold, Jeffrey M. Christian, vice president of the commodity research group at Goldman, Sachs & Co., New York, last week recommended buying gold. He asserts that tightening supplies and cyclical changes in the U.S. economy will fuel a gradual, prolonged surge in gold prices over the next several years."The time has come" to start buying gold again, Mr. Christian said at a Goldman Sachs gold seminar last week.Jeffrey A. Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors, is another optimist. "Rising investor interest could give gold a sharp, swift kick to higher levels," he says.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Consumers boosted their spending only modestly in August, the latest sign of the U.S. economy struggling to gain steam as worries about government policies cloud the outlook.Personal consumption, a broad measure of spending on everything from refrigerators to health care, rose 0.3% in August from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Friday. Adjusted for inflation, spending climbed 0.2%.The gains, while a slight pickup from July, showed consumers maintaining a relatively cautious stance as they moved into the fall. That could diminish hopes for a pickup in economic growth in the second half of the year.Many economists say household spending is likely to slow if Washington's budget battles spook consumers, businesses and investors.Consumer confidence already appears to have taken a hit after climbing into the summer: The University of Michigan reported Friday that its latest gauge of consumer sentiment fell to a five-month low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In this decade, we have had more than our share of big-time booms and busts: the tech bubble, the housing bubble and, this year, what Warren Buffett has called the Treasury bubble.For some years now, I have been a student of these extreme financial cycles. In the 1980s, I witnessed firsthand the Texas real-estate bubble and covered companies crushed in the junk-bond bubble. I wrote a book about the crash of 1929. And to my terrific shame, at the top of an inflated market, I once paid $50 for a $5 Beanie Baby named Peace.In studying what drives bubbles, I've come to believe that they follow fairly regular patterns. If we could learn to recognize these, we might be more astute in reacting and adjusting our own behavior. And even if we can't see beyond the excitement they generate, there are underlying lessons for investors.-- Fertile ground. The biggest bubbles appear to develop during periods of rapid and radical innovation, which may leave us more vulnerable to accepting the bizarre rationalizations that often accompany financial speculation.In the 1920s, the automobile came into its own, and many homes were wired for electricity. Radio wasn't around at all in 1920; by 1929, it was in one of three households, bringing entertainment, music and headlines to millions. Amid all that, there were two tremendous financial bubbles -- the 1925 Florida land grab and the roaring stock market that preceded the crash.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Reaffirming its landmark 1976 campaign-finance decision, the Supreme Court ruled that states may impose limits on campaign contributions to candidates for statewide office.In a 6-3 decision, the justices said a Missouri law that capped contributions to statewide candidates at different levels, with an inflation adjustment, didn't violate free-speech rights. The law was challenged in 1998 by a small political-action group, Shrink Missouri Government PAC. The law was upheld by a U.S. district court in Missouri but overturned by the U.S. Appeals Court for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis.The decision was announced yesterday, as Iowans prepared to vote in their state's caucuses in the kickoff of the 2000 campaign season. The timing highlighted the growing public disgust with the huge amount of money needed to mount a campaign and the amount of influence -- and sometimes corruption -- that such contributions often bring.As a result, both advocates and critics of campaign-finance laws had been interested in whether the high court would use the Missouri case to redraw the landscape created by its 1976 decision, Buckley vs. Valeo. At that time, the justices ruled that the Constitution permitted limits on campaign contributions but not on campaign spending. The current limit on contributions by individuals in federal elections is $1,000, slightly below the upper limit of $1,075 in the Missouri case.Writing for the majority, Justice David Souter addressed the corruption issue, which was the prime justification for the Missouri law. "There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption on our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LONDON -- Recent declines in interest rates encouraged two borrowers to launch Eurodollar bonds, but their offerings failed to find much support as many investors continued to avoid the market.New Zealand launched two $100 million offerings with maturities of four and seven years. The issues were launched at costs of 45 and 55 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury yields, respectively. Those margins were roughly in line with issues outstanding, but didn't greatly appeal to investors. A basis point is 1/100 of a percent.New Zealand's $100 million of 7 3/4% bonds due June 18, 1990 were priced at 100 1/8 to yield 7.71%. Another $100 million of 8% bonds due June 18, 1993 were priced at 99 1/4 to yield 8.145%.The two issues will refinance debt, and New Zealand is expected to keep the proceeds in dollars. "They like the rates the way they are," said an official at lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd."Nothing's moving quickly," one syndicate manager said. "There's just no buying interest around." Many investors remain uncertain about the direction of the dollar and U.S. interest rates, and so are avoiding fresh commitments, he said. The backlog of unsold issues also continues to hobble the market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- It's time to call a halt to the bond market's infatuation with the monthly employment data and look further afield for new ways to detect wage inflation.That's the argument advanced by growing numbers of economists and market participants, as Americans continue to find jobs at a steady clip and the unemployment rate drops sharply. Weary of the bond-market gyrations touched off by each monthly employment report, they have embarked on a quest for new clues about inflation. Some are even putting their faith in anecdotal evidence instead of the sometimes confounding signals from the statistical data."The employment numbers are becoming increasingly less relevant as the numbers of people finding jobs has grown," argues Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. "Frankly, there aren't that many people left to hire. . . . A gain of 300,000 in today's labor market is the equivalent of what would have been [a] massive gain of 700,000 jobs four years ago."The reason, Ms. Kimelman says, is that as the rate at which Americans find new jobs has leveled off at around 230,000 a month, the unemployment rate continues to fall and average hourly earnings continue to climb. Indeed, Friday's report showed that average hourly earnings rose six cents in August to $11.87, the highest level seen since December 1990, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%. Those factors helped cap the Treasury market's "relief" rally, touched off when traders saw that the overall job growth was within expected bounds."The fixation on the `big' overall number of new jobs isn't sane," says one trader, disgruntled after a day of fielding more calls than he says he gets in an average week, all from clients seeking insight into a single figure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Board approved a special loan facility to ease any liquidity pressures on banks that arise at the end of this year. But the board denied bankers' requests to lower the interest rate to be charged on the loans.The board voted unanimously to create a Century Date Change Special Liquidity Facility, which will let banks borrow funds at a rate 1.5 percentage points above the Fed's target for the federal funds rate, which is 5%. The program will be available from Oct. 1, 1999, through April 7, 2000, one month longer than originally proposed.Some banks anticipate great demand for cash toward the year's end because of the Year 2000 computer problem, which is expected to render some software unable to differentiate between 2000 and 1900. Recognizing the uncertainty people have about the consequences of the date change on banks' computers, the Fed has promised to have extra cash on hand to avoid potential disruptions."When there are strange distributions or unusual distributions of reserves, banks under pressure that ordinarily wouldn't be under pressure, this will be there to help them out," a Fed official told reporters."By ensuring the ready availability of funds, the facility should enable depositories and their customers to enter into agreements to meet possible credit needs with greater confidence," the Fed said in a memorandum. "The facility also should help to damp any tendency for money markets to tighten owing to inevitable difficulties . . . in gauging the overall supply and demand for reserves each day."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Bond prices were little changed in subdued trading yesterday as investors braced for the government's latest report this morning on employment.The employment data for January are likely to prompt the Federal Reserve Board to push interest rates higher in an attempt to cool the fast-growing economy, many analysts and investors say. The report is expected to show that non-farm employment grew a strong 292,000, while the civilian unemployment rate held steady at 5.3% last month, according to the average estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.If employment growth is as robust as economists expect, it would put pressure on the Federal Open Market Committee to tighten monetary policy when the Fed policy-making body meets Tuesday and Wednesday, analysts said.The report is likely to lead to a "volatile and erratic day," of trading, said Robert Falconer, a senior vice president in bond trading at CRT Government Securites Ltd. here. "There is a strong likelihood that we will see a lot of selling."The data might also be used as a guiding light for finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations -- the U.S., Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Canada and Italy. They will be meeting in Washington today to discuss the prospects for reducing the U.S. budget deficit and for maintaining stable currency rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LONDON -- The firmer dollar helped boost Eurodollar bond prices 1/8 to 1/4 point, but the improvement wasn't enough to encourage much retail buying."It's definitely the stronger dollar," one dealer at a Swiss bank said, noting that the U.S. currency rose on the smaller-than-expected U.S. August trade deficit of $13.32 billion. The deficit, which was below the $18.04 billion initially reported for August and the revised $16.05 billion July trade gap, could herald stronger than expected U.S. third-quarter growth. But that had little impact on the currency-conscious Eurobond market, bond specialists said.The dollar "is where the primary focus is at the moment," one new-issue manager said.With the West German central bank also providing early support for the U.S. currency, the dollar firmed in late trading against the mark.U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the shrinking of the August trade gap "may be the turning point in our trade deficit" and cited the drop in imports of manufactured goods, "where the decline in the dollar may be taking hold."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>GOOGLE IS buying YouTube. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings is snaring Chicago Board of Trade parent CBOT Holdings. Eli Lilly is gobbling up Icos. The list goes on and on in what is shaping up to be quite a year for mergers, with deals involving U.S. targets up about 9% this year from last year, according to the Mergers & Acquisitions Report.But here's something to keep in mind, especially if you're an investor in an acquiring company: Over time, based on postdeal stock prices, sellers often have proven to be smarter than buyers. That isn't to say there aren't smart buyers, including PepsiCo, which has effectively used acquisitions to diversify and grow. Or J.M. Smucker, the jelly company, which several years ago bought the Jif brand of peanut butter from Procter & Gamble. (Talk about synergy!)But the reality is that "the seller always has better information," says Harbir Singh, professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Seems obvious enough, but try telling that to investors in companies such as America Online after it swallowed Time Warner in a deal valued at more than $100 billion. Or Mattel, after its misguided $3.8 billion purchase of Learning Co. Or Quaker Oats, after its botched $1.7 billion acquisition of Snapple.The difference between a good deal and a bad one often boils down to little more than hubris, or just plain ego, which can cause a buyer to overpay. "It's not that sellers are smarter than buyers," says Richard Roll, a finance professor at UCLA's Anderson School of Management and author of "The Hubris Hypothesis of Corporate Takeovers." "It's just that buyers are overconfident in their ability to value what they're going to buy."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When a new Bloomberg poll finds that 44% of Americans feel that the economy is "worse than when Obama was inaugurated" (versus only 34% who say it is "better"), you know the economic recovery is pretty anemic. Now the Joint Economic Committee has chronicled how weak it is compared to others since World War II.In a report entitled "Unchartered Depths," the Committee finds that "employment is now 5.0% below what it was at the start of the recession, 38 months ago. This compares to an average rise in employment of 3.7% over the same period in prior post-WWII recessions."On economic growth, real GDP has risen 0.8% over the 13 quarters since the recession began, compared to an average increase of 9.9% in past recoveries. From the beginning of the recession to April 2011, real personal income has grown just .9% compared to 9.4% for the same period in previous post 1960 recessions.The standard response from Obama apologists is that recession of 2008 and 2009 was different because, as former Clinton administration economist Robert Shapiro puts it, "this was a financial crisis, and these take longer to recover from." In fact, in most cases, the deeper the recession, the stronger the recovery to make up for lost ground.That was what Ronald Reagan's critics said when the U.S. economy soared during 1983 and 1984 with quarterly growth numbers exceeding 7%. At the time, liberal Keynesians yawned and declared the good times nothing more than a normal snapback from the deep recession.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HANOVER, N.H.--An increasingly confident Mitt Romney is looking beyond his Republican rivals and again focusing his attacks on President Barack Obama, using a three-day swing through New Hampshire to frame his candidacy as a choice between the president's "entitlement society" and the "merit society" Mr. Romney envisions.In an interview late Wednesday, Mr. Romney reflected a new tone--a more biting version of his earlier rhetoric against the president--predicting Mr. Obama will resort to "a politics of envy and divisiveness and demonizing of business and business people that will shock" voters."A campaign of envy and class warfare, I think, will ultimately be unsuccessful, whether in the primary or in the general election," he said. "I can surely tell you that Republicans will not warm to a campaign that is attacking success."In what amounts to his closing argument before voters decide early next month in Iowa and New Hampshire, the former Massachusetts governor is hoping to transcend the recent squabbles of the primary race and train his sights on a general election that he and his aides now believe is within reach.Many Republicans remain ambivalent about Mr. Romney, and polls still show a tight national race. But Mr. Romney's position has improved in recent days as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has seen his support weaken in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Matt WhittakerNEW YORK--Silver prices soared toward $50 an ounce, though they pulled back sharply toward the end of the day, sparking some speculation that the metal's stunning three-month rally may be nearing an end.At one point during the day, silver futures were up 8.2% at $49.82 an ounce. They closed at $47.1510, still the highest in 31 years. Prices have jumped 52% this year, and the intraday high exceeded the nominal closing record of $48.70 set back in 1980. The failure to reach $50 an ounce is one sign that the rally may be losing steam."The way we've come off, there's a possibility we've seen a high for the near term," said Frank Lesh, a broker and futures analyst with FuturePath Trading.Silver is riding on the coattails of gold, as investors have flocked to precious metals due to their safe-haven status amid a weakening dollar. Silver's gains have recently outpaced those of gold futures, which on Monday settled 0.4% higher at a new record of $1,508.60 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold is up 6% year-to-date.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HANOI--Vietnam's leaders are stepping up their campaign against critical blogs, ordering government investigators to arrest the operators of three websites at a time when global Internet companies are growing more worried about doing business in the tightly policed country.A government statement issued late Wednesday named three blogs that allegedly posted articles accusing the government of corruption and human-rights abuses, describing the blogs as being part of a "wicked plot of the hostile forces"--a term often used to describe advocates of democratic reforms.Two of the three sites vowed to continue. One, Danlambao, or "The People's Journalism Blog," said in a fresh posting Thursday that its anonymous operators are "prepared to be repressed and imprisoned rather than leading the life of a dumb dog that dares not to bark," paving the way for a deepening confrontation between Vietnam's authoritarian leaders and its increasingly vibrant online community as the country's once-booming economy slumps.The Web has taken off here faster than in many other up-and-coming nations. Around 34% of Vietnam's 90 million people are online, a larger proportion than in more established neighbors such as Thailand and Indonesia, driven in part by the rapid spread of high-speed cellphone networks and a desire among younger Vietnamese to connect with the rest of the world separately from the nation's state-run media.Growing numbers of Vietnamese have launched their own blogs in recent months, where they discuss everything from traditional folk songs and where to buy secondhand iPhones to the corruption that has accompanied a decadelong economic expansion here. One prominent blogger, 60-year-old retired soldier Ng Thuong Thuy, writes forcefully under his own name about injustices in Vietnam's legal systems, especially the explosive issue of land rights which government-controlled media rarely cover.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ST. LOUIS -- White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers said Monday that there were signs the U.S. economy was returning to normal, but he warned that "major slack" remained and that weak demand would continue to crimp output."[L]ack of demand will be the major constraint on output and employment in the American economy for the foreseeable future," Mr. Summers told the annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economics here. "The combination of low capacity utilization and substantial leveraging of household balance sheets raises questions about the sustainability of demand growth going forward."Mr. Summers spoke after the NABE released its annual forecast. "The good news is that this deep and long recession appears to be over, and with improving credit markets, the U.S. economy can return to solid growth next year without worry about inflation," said NABE President-elect Lynn Reaser of Point Loma Nazarene University in California.More than 80% of the 44 forecasters surveyed by the NABE believe the economic recovery has begun, but they anticipate modest growth -- a 2.9% pace in the second half of 2009 and a 3% rate next year. They predict the Federal Reserve won't begin raising interest from the current zero-0.25% range until late next spring and won't lift its key short-term interest rate above 1% before 2011.The NABE members said markets would take time to heal from the economic crisis. Most said markets wouldn't improve to the point where they no longer hurt economic growth until after the first half of next year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Today's Market Forecast]Mortal CoilThe good news about last year's flat stock market? Stocks got cheaper. The bad news? They could get cheaper still.In 2005, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had one of the most uninspiring annual performances of its 109-year history, finishing the year down 0.6% -- which is to say almost perfectly flat. The broader market did a bit better, but with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gaining 3%, it, too, drew yawns rather than applause.But even as the market treaded water, corporate profits grew quickly. Company analysts polled by Reuters Estimates predict that earnings for companies in the S&P 500 increased 13.6% in 2005. Because the S&P 500 went up less than its earnings, it's price/earnings ratio slipped. On Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 16.4 times 2005 earnings. It finished 2004 at 18 times that year's earnings. In fact, it's the lowest S&P 500 P/E ratio in 10 years.</TEXT>

It was at 79.27 to the dollar early Friday.

    <TEXT>Paris -- AFTER A GOOD RUN on European stocks, it may be time for investors to go Stateside.Since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in mid-2004 -- and especially this year -- European stock markets have outperformed the U.S. by a wide margin. But with the Fed nearing the end of its policy of monetary restraint and the European Central Bank about to start raising rates, probably as early as today, it could be Wall Street's chance to shine.Contending the ECB is as determined as the Fed to push interest rates to levels it thinks are right to damp inflation, Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities, says this resolve "could inhibit euro-zone equity-market performance just as Fed policy has hampered Wall Street." European stocks, he adds, "could be in for a period of underperformance, while the U.S. stock market makes up for some lost time."For the year to date, the Dow Jones Stoxx index of 600 leading European companies is up 19.3%. That compares with a measly 0.2% advance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 3.1% increase in the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.Behind the performance disparity is a Fed that in the past 17 months has steadily raised rates to 4% from 1%. Meanwhile, the ECB has left its key refinancing rate unchanged at 2% for 29 months and hasn't increased it in more than five years. In fact, since global stock markets bottomed on March 12, 2003, European equities -- on a total- return basis, which includes dividends reinvested -- have outperformed Wall Street by 56%, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Momentous changes are under way in what central banks are and what they do. We are used to thinking that central banks' main task is to guide the economy by setting interest rates. Central banks' main tools used to be "open-market" operations, i.e. purchasing short-term Treasury debt, and short-term lending to banks.Since the 2008 financial crisis, however, the Federal Reserve has intervened in a wide variety of markets, including commercial paper, mortgages and long-term Treasury debt. At the height of the crisis, the Fed lent directly to teetering nonbank institutions, such as insurance giant AIG, and participated in several shotgun marriages, most notably between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.These "nontraditional" interventions are not going away anytime soon. Many Fed officials, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, see "credit constraints" and "segmented markets" throughout the economy, which the Fed's standard tools don't address. Moreover, interest rates near zero have rendered those tools nearly powerless, so the Fed will naturally search for bigger guns. In his speech Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Bernanke made it clear that "we should not rule out the further use of such [nontraditional] policies if economic conditions warrant."But the Fed has crossed a bright line. Open-market operations do not have direct fiscal consequences, or directly allocate credit. That was the price of the Fed's independence, allowing it to do one thing -- conduct monetary policy -- without short-term political pressure. But an agency that allocates credit to specific markets and institutions, or buys assets that expose taxpayers to risks, cannot stay independent of elected, and accountable, officials.In addition, the Fed is now a gargantuan financial regulator. Its inspectors examine too-big-to-fail banks, come up with creative "stress tests" for them to pass, and haggle over thousands of pages of regulation. When we think of the Fed 10 years from now, on current trends, we're likely to think of it as financial czar first, with monetary policy the boring backwater.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After a 20-year absence, Ford Motor Co. is back in Thailand. Considering the country's economy, this isn't the perfect time to plunge back in. But, armed with some aggressive -- and risky-financing strategies, Ford is gaining strength in a difficult market.The world's No. 2 auto maker, which left Thailand in the '70s to focus on the U.S. market, returned about two years ago -- before the Asian economic crisis hit -- and now is seeking to become a market leader committed to offering auto loans to Thais when rivals can't or won't. Credit for auto loans is tight and sales have plummeted 75% since a currency devaluation walloped the country's economy last year.Ford is raising the stakes for itself by offering U.S.-style come-ons, including 0% interest. It's a big gamble, considering that the government has closed dozens of finance companies because of debt problems. Industry experts warn that Ford risks high default and repossession rates and a price war as wounded competitors match low interest rates.But "price and financing are the main reasons people are buying right now," not brands or resale value, says Siriluk Aroondechachai, who took over her father's Ford dealership two years ago.Ms. Siriluk, through Ford's finance subsidiary, Primus Leasing Co., can offer a menu of financing options, including once-yearly payments for Thai farmers that coincide with sugar-cane harvests in northeastern Thailand, where she runs her dealership. During March, Ms. Siriluk, a 25-year-old with a degree in economics from Baylor University in Texas, sold 60 trucks in Thailand-enough to make some U.S. dealers envious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. reached a tentative deal this weekend to pay $13 billion to end a number of civil investigations into its sale of mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, but a separate and potentially more serious criminal probe into the bank and its executives will continue.The Justice Department, convinced it has strong evidence related to the bank's conduct and eager to send a message to Wall Street, rebuffed repeated attempts by J.P. Morgan to settle the criminal investigation without admitting wrongdoing and agreed only to resolve the civil investigations. It also threatened last Thursday to file its civil case this coming Wednesday if the two sides can't reach a final deal, said people close to the talks.The proposed pact includes $4 billion to settle claims by the Federal Housing Finance Agency that J.P. Morgan misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about the quality of the mortgage securities it sold them, another $4 billion in consumer relief, and $5 billion in penalties paid by the bank, according to people familiar with the deal. But the two sides remain apart on several issues related to the civil settlement, including whether the bank should have to admit that it didn't follow its own due-diligence standards in packaging the mortgages into securities it could sell, according to people familiar with the discussions.The talks come as the bank faces an uphill battle in Washington. Once a favorite in the capital, J.P. Morgan now is grappling with a bruised reputation and fractured relationship with regulators in the wake of the "London whale" trading fiasco out of the bank's U.K. headquarters. The trades, which lost the bank $6.5 billion, transformed J.P. Morgan from an institution that seemingly could do no wrong to one under heavy and unyielding scrutiny.When top bankers assembled at the White House in early October, J.P. Morgan's James Dimon found his name card on a seat in the corner, far from his usual perch across from President Barack Obama. Mr. Dimon, who in previous gatherings had been quick to share his opinions with the president, was reserved and said little during the meeting, according to people who attended. Other chief executives saw his placement as a symbolic shift.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Moshe A. MilevskySit back for a moment and ponder something unpleasant: How would a large, sustained drop in the stock market affect your personal finances? More specifically, imagine the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 6500--its March 2009 level--and staying there.I suspect that most of you are thinking about the wretched blow this would deal to your retirement savings and stock portfolio. And it no doubt would. But here's my advice: Think more broadly. Most important, think about how such a drop would affect your paycheck and your career.It will depend on the person, of course. Earnings in some professions are tightly linked to the stock market--an investment banker, say, or portfolio manager or financial adviser--while others, such as hospital nurses or tenured professors, are relatively immune to these zigs and zags. Most people will fall somewhere in between.Consider this an exercise in personal risk management. It isn't intended to gauge whether you believe the stock market will test those levels again, and I'm not asking whether you are bullish or bearish. That is not what personal risk management is about, even if it is how most people practice it. The issue here is: If the bear returns for a prolonged visit, regardless of your subjective view of these odds, how would it affect your current and future earning power? And--more important--are you properly considering it when creating your investment portfolio?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's abrupt credit easing and the dollar's sharp fall will help avert a recession next year, according to many economists and investment managers. But they also predict that inflation and interest rates will rebound next year.Since the Oct. 19 stock market crash, interest rates have tumbled more than 1 1/2 percentage points as the Federal Reserve suddenly opened the monetary spigot in an effort to calm the financial markets. Last week, the Reagan administration emphasized that its top priority is to prevent a recession, even if that means a lower dollar.These policies may only provide "a respite" for the credit markets, says John Paulus, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Co. "This is a strategy to avoid serious action on (cutting) the budget deficit while liquifying our way past a recession. The Republicans are whistling past the graveyard by doing nothing."Radford Rigsby, a portfolio manager for the Harvard Management Co., says he is "very cynical" about the recent bond market rally and remains concerned about the long-term inflation outlook. Although the dollar already has declined as much as 7% against most major currencies during the past three weeks, "we may have to wait until the end of 1988 before we see a big rise in inflation," he says."I own a lot of bonds right now, but I'm not sure how much longer I'll hold on. I'm grappling with what to do," says Jim Rogers, a private investor and professor of finance at Columbia University.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Currency traders returned to a strategy that some say is the only clear bet they can make: buy Europe, sell Japan.What that amounted to was the same market pattern repeated on numerous occasions in recent weeks -- the dollar falling against the mark, but rising against the yen, alongside a healthy rally in mark/yen.Analysts said Tuesday's quarter-percentage-point cut in the U.S. Fed funds rate suggests the Federal Reserve will make additional easings before year end, a process many believe will weigh on the dollar. Lower U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets less attractive.Notwithstanding recent signs that German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder favors softer monetary policy, the Bundesbank is believed to be adamantly opposed to German rate cuts. Add to this situation some additional bad news on Japanese banks yesterday and mark/yen looked like a strong buy, traders said."Mark/yen has been the favorite play of the past few weeks. If [the mark] gets through the 82/83 yen level, it will look like people are really coming back to start selling yen again," said John McCarthy, vice president, foreign exchange, at ING Barings Capital Markets in New York.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Anyone who questions the remarkable relationship that binds the economy and the stock market should ponder briefly the circumstances that immediately preceded the recent surge in share prices. On July 31, the Commerce Department announced that its composite index of leading economic indicators dropped 0.9% in June. And on Aug. 1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 19.33 points. Further steep increases followed, so that by last week's end the average was 102.81 points above its July 31 level.There's no short, simple explanation of the linkage between the economy and stock market. But any serious effort to appraise one's prospects entails close attention to the other. An obvious tie involves profits. If it becomes clear that a company's profits are on the rise, demand for its shares is likely to increase, tending to push up their price. A subtler connection involves interest rates. Securities that offer fixed rates of interest compete for investors' dollars with common stocks, which offer dividends that may rise or fall according to changes in profitability. When interest rates fall, this renders interest-paying securities relatively less attractive. It's no coincidence that in general before the recent market surge profits were sharply on the rise and interest rates on the decline.In all, a wide variety of factors can play upon the market. Among them are shifts in investor confidence, concern about rising or falling prices, worry over higher taxes or stiffer governmental regulations, changes in so-called margin requirements that limit what investors may borrow to buy stocks, the flow of money from overseas, major strikes and the failure of a large corporation. But business-cycle history leaves little doubt that the fundamental influence is the broad economic trend.The 0.9% drop in the Commerce Department's leading-indicator index in June has been widely interpreted as a signal that the economy, at the least, will grow at a slower pace in coming months. This, in turn, has been seen as a good reason to invest in common stocks, since a slower-paced expansion would presumably last longer and be accompanied by somewhat lower interest rates.The record shows, however, that a decline of only a month or two in the leading-indicator index by no means guarantees an economic slowing. In fact, the June drop was the first monthly decline since August 1982. Moreover, it's possible that subsequent revisions in the various components of the Commerce index may eventually turn the decline into an increase. Several times since August 1982 reported monthly declines in the index have indeed been revised into gains.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dow Jones Newswires[Today's Market Forecast]Inflation, Real and ImaginedIt shouldn't shock anyone that a dollar doesn't go as far as it used to. Still, today's inflation report could be an eye-opener.Economists surveyed by and CNBC estimate, on average, that the Labor Department's September consumer-price index will show that prices picked up by 0.9% from their August level. That would be the biggest monthly gain since 1990. The economists' estimate would put the CPI 4.4% higher than it was a year earlier. That would be the biggest year-on-year gain since 1991.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Many options traders were reluctant to take advantage of puts and calls whose prices have been discounted ahead of the Labor Day weekend.With the financial markets closed Monday in observance of the holiday, specialists are lowering volatility -- an important part of an options price -- to attract buyers.A broad barometer of options prices, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, declined 0.31 to 19.28, a level that is widely regarded as indicating that prices are cheap.Specialists hope discounted prices will persuade traders to buy their options, which would transfer "time decay" off their trading sheets.Time decay is the amount of money an options contract loses each day as it approaches expiration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>GOLDEN, Colo. -- Atlas Air Inc., which provides freight flights for airlines, is expected to announce an agreement today to fly three Boeing 747 jumbo jet cargo planes for Federal Express Corp.The outsourcing deal, valued at more than $30 million in annual revenue for Atlas, is believed to be part of FedEx's strategy to restructure operations to reduce reliance on its own pilots. By contracting some international shipping to low-cost Atlas, FedEx risks further rankling its higher-paid pilots during contentious contract negotiations.Federal Express, a unit of FDX Corp., Memphis, Tenn., declined to comment.Atlas, a six-year-old concern that founder Michael A. Chowdry has built into the world's largest operator of 747 freighters, said service for FedEx would begin in the fourth quarter. Atlas will provide two 747-400 freighters, a 747-200 cargo plane plus crews, maintenance and insurance. The company declined to say how long the FedEx contract would last.Last year, Atlas provided two planes for extra seasonal lift to FedEx in the fourth quarter and, in 1996, provided one plane for FedEx.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Before initiating legislation to change the way the financial markets work, the Senate Banking Committee seems inclined to give the existing regulatory structure a chance to implement some of the reforms recommended by the Brady task force.Four days of hearings by the panel last week made it clear that, less than a month after being released, the task force's central conclusion -- that the separate financial markets actually operate as one -- has become part of Washington's conventional wisdom. And the recommendations the presidential commission on the crash drew from that conclusion have effectively become the congressional agenda for change.But not for legislative action -- at least this year.Most members of the banking panel reacted favorably to several of the Brady report's recommendations -- especially its calls for better clearing systems; for coordinated intermarket regulation; and for cross-market "circuit breakers," such as trading halts. But before trying to implement those changes themselves, by giving either the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission new powers, the lawmakers indicated they want to see if the current regulatory system can do the job."Try to do what you can, working cooperatively with the other bodies involved, to make the necessary changes in the markets without congressional action," Sen. Christopher Bond (R., Mo.) told John Phelan, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, in a comment typical of several made during the hearings. "We are willing, if it's absolutely necessary, to move legislation. . . . But we would hope that this process could move along with self-initiated efforts."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OTTAWA -- Canadian business confidence has picked up, encouraged by a decline in interest rates and by a drop in the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart.The Conference Board of Canada said its index of business confidence rose 16.1% in the first quarter to its highest level since the 1989 fourth quarter.The board, an economic research group, said its latest survey of business attitudes showed that 55.6% of business leaders expect Canadian economic conditions to improve over the next six months, up from 37.9% in the 1991 fourth quarter.Paul Darby, director of the board's surveys, attributed the improved sentiment partly to a 6% decline in the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in the past six months. The decline boosted the profits of Canadian companies that sell goods priced in U.S. dollars. Noranda Inc., a Toronto natural resources company, said a one-cent decline in the exchange value of the Canadian dollar would increase its 1992 profit by about 21 million Canadian dollars (US$17.6 million).Canadian business confidence also has been strengthened by a drop of seven percentage points in short-term interest rates in the past two years, and by the recent pickup in the U.S. economy, which takes more than three-quarters of Canada's exports.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- A Senate committee easily approved emergency aid for the jobless, amid signs of a Republican split over an issue that has suddenly become a top Democratic priority.The Senate Finance Committee voted 16-4 for a measure, introduced just this week by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), extending unemployment benefits to more jobless workers and for a longer period in many cases. Five of the panel's nine Republicans joined all 11 Democrats in voting for the bill. Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who opposed it, nonetheless indicated that he was trying to get the Bush administration to soften its opposition and back some compromise.Meanwhile, House leaders released details of a separate measure that, like the Senate bill, is on a fast track toward possible passage before Congress departs for its August recess. The House bill would leave it to the president to decide whether the bill for added benefits would be paid for by raising taxes on employers or by declaring the spending an emergency exempt from the ceilings in last fall's budget agreement. The Senate bill, to take effect, relies on the president to designate an emergency, which administration officials oppose.Congressional Democrats' flurry of action comes about a year after the recession began, and when it is generally thought to be ending. That delay has embarrassed many Democrats, given the party's traditional fealty to labor. But key leaders feared that any relief measure would lack sufficient votes if it meant raising the employer payroll taxes that finance the unemployment compensation system. Defending the late response, Democrats note that joblessness typically persists even as recessions wane because recovering businesses don't rush to recall workers or hire new ones.Currently, the jobless first get up to 26 weeks of state benefits. In states with high unemployment, they can receive an extension of up to 13 weeks more at a cost shared by state and federal governments. But many unemployed workers don't qualify for the extended benefits, given state restrictions on eligibility and high thresholds for the state unemployment rates that trigger extended aid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can't move these days without bumping into an economic pessimist. "Recession in America looks increasingly likely," said the Economist magazine on Nov. 17. Two days later, in the International Herald Tribune, Nobel Prize winner Paul A. Samuelson brought up the specter of the Great Depression. And then, on Nov. 26, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers wrote in the Financial Times that, "the odds now favor a recession that slows growth significantly on a global basis."The pressure on policy makers to do something is intense. Not only is there a desire to see the government get even more involved in the housing loan market -- witness the Bush administration's plan to freeze starter rates -- there is also tremendous pressure on the Fed to make another large 50 basis-point rate cut in attempt to alleviate credit-market problems.This desire for government intervention to fix problems that grown adults have created for themselves is dangerous. Constantly counting on the government to save the economy undermines confidence in free markets, conditions people to believe they don't have to live with bad decisions, and creates a willingness to take imprudent risk. Actions to stabilize the economy in the short term can destabilize it in the longer term, and set the stage for even more intervention to fix the new problems at a later date.Moreover, all this pessimism makes serious economic problems less likely. If it really happens, a recession in the next year could be the most anticipated ever. That fact alone makes it improbable. Recessions usually surprise the consensus. When a recession is expected, the odds of rapidly rising inventories, excessive investment, or a surprise drop in new orders are reduced.In the past, when manufacturing was a larger share of the economy and inventory control was less exact, recessions often began abruptly, sometimes on the heels of very strong growth. Today, with services a larger share of the economy, and technology speeding up information flow, the economy tends to glide more gently into recession. Given this, all the doom and gloom seems unnecessary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The former head trader at a hedge-fund giant settled regulatory allegations that he systematically attempted to manipulate prices of platinum and palladium, a sign that commodities regulators are intensifying efforts to crack down on manipulation in the futures markets.Christopher Pia--former head trader at hedge fund Moore Capital and a major player at the fund for 18 years--agreed to pay $1 million to settle civil allegations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator said in a release Monday. The CFTC alleged that he tried to artificially move futures prices near the very end of daily trading in a maneuver called "banging the close," which involves inundating the market with trading orders. The $1 million penalty is one of the largest ever levied by the CFTC against an individual.The settlement comes amid a boom in which the prices of metals and other commodities have skyrocketed, raising concerns at the CFTC about possible manipulation and abusive practices. One way investors bet on commodities is through the futures market, where they enter into contracts to buy or sell raw materials at a set price on a specified date. The CFTC now has a broader mandate and new tools to attack violations in the commodities markets.Under the CFTC settlement, the 45-year-old Mr. Pia, once one of the most powerful traders on Wall Street, also agreed to a permanent ban in trading CFTC-regulated products in platinum and palladium, such as futures contracts. He also is banned from trading instruments regulated by the CFTC during the closing period, the final few minutes of trading when settlement prices are determined. Mr. Pia hasn't traded in the contracts involved in the settlement since May 2008, according to a person close to the situation.A lawyer for Mr. Pia declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Pia said Mr. Pia "is pleased to have settled with the CFTC in order to put this matter behind him. Pia Capital, his current firm, is committed to abiding by the CFTC Order and to maintaining the highest level of compliance." He settled without admitting or denying wrongdoing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The divergent fortunes of global emerging markets can be told through Latin America's two biggest economies: Mexico and Brazil.Think of it as a tortoise-and-hare story. For the past decade, Brazil has boomed by selling raw materials to China. Its expanding middle class gorged on a tide of cheap credit unleashed by central banks in advanced economies as they tried to energize their recoveries.Brazil's economy averaged 3.6% annual growth over the past decade, peaking at a 7.5% pace in 2010. Its currency surged in value.All the usual signs of excess were in evidence: Brazilian shoppers cramming stores in New York and Miami; news stories reporting $30 cheese pizzas and $35 martinis in Sao Paulo.By comparison, Mexico has seen lackluster growth, partly because it has been tied to a struggling U.S. economy. It has also suffered from deep problems of its own: laws that banned foreign investment in energy, a dysfunctional tax code, a tattered education system and hidebound economy dominated by a handful of near-monopolies. And it suffered a surge in drug violence, deterring tourists and investors.</TEXT>

He said that New York entered the market yesterday with the dollar strong, "but the dollar failed to set a new high, with the result that the market felt this was a good signal to sell dollars, so the dollar fell back during the course of the day.

    <TEXT>Americans have forgotten how to save in recent years.First, we came to regard the stock market as our piggy bank; if we needed a little spending money, surely we could always sell a few shares of stock or a bit of a mutual fund at a profit. Then, we viewed our houses as money machines that would always provide a surplus of cash on a moment's notice, since real estate "never goes down in value."All that has changed, at least for now. People finally have again realized how important it is to save. After all, thrift was once one of the quintessential American virtues: Just think of Benjamin Franklin intoning, "A penny saved is a penny earned."Our ancestors knew what we had forgotten until recently: Unless you save, you cannot make your wealth grow. It's much easier to tell ourselves that our horse will come in at the racetrack, or that we will win the lottery if we just keep playing 4-7-10-14-36-51, or that some stock we heard about online is the next Google, or that we can simply use our credit cards to buy whatever we feel like today and pay it all back tomorrow . . . after our horse comes in at the racetrack.But Benjamin Franklin was right when he wrote: "Human felicity is produc'd not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BOSTON -- With the Big Dig more than halfway done, is it time to start on Big Dig II?A five-year, $4 million study nearing completion by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority says yes. The study found that drilling beneath downtown Boston and connecting North and South stations with a 1.1-mile, four-track train tunnel would yield huge transportation benefits and could even pay for itself.Perhaps the most shocking conclusion of the report so far is that the cost of linking Boston's primary train stations has actually gone down since the first study of the project was completed in 1993. The study has the project's price tag at $3.68 billion, which, after adjusting for inflation, is 35% less than the 1993 figure. That's mostly because new electric-diesel locomotives significantly reduce the number of tracks that need to be electrified for the project."Everybody should get down on their knees and pray that it happens," says Bob O'Brien, chairman of a citizens advisory committee that is reviewing the study.For the project to proceed, the full report needs to be published and subjected to comments from the public and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Finally, the project backer -- which could be the MBTA, Amtrak or another entity -- would issue a proposal with specific plans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The old dragon of inflation -- thought to have been slain -- may be lurking.Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, aren't worried -- yet. But there have been confusing warning signs in recent weeks. Core inflation, the prices consumers pay for goods and services, excluding food and energy, increased 0.5% in both January and February. Hourly earnings jumped 0.5% in March and are running at a 4% annual rate of increase for the first three months of the year.It's a fluke, say Federal Reserve officials, who believe that the economy is too soft to support a round of big price increases. But that view may be rattled tomorrow and Friday, when the Labor Department releases new data on movement on the producer price and consumer price indexes in March. If the numbers show another solid increase in prices, it could incite much more serious worries about inflation.Low inflation has been one of the bittersweet benefits of this unusually sluggish recovery. Demand hasn't been strong enough to allow retailers and producers to up the prices of goods. And a weak labor market has kept wages relatively subdued. As a result, consumer prices edged up their smallest amount in six years during 1992.But now that the economy is showing signs of firming, some businesses are trying to push through price increases, hoping the market will finally bear it. "Industry sectors are trying to recoup what they gave up in the depth of the downturn," said Mark Steinkrauss, vice president of investor relations for Fruit of the Loom Inc. The company raised prices 5% on a line of T-shirts at the start of the year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>{An Editorial Series}Far from being an impregnable fortress of "uncontrollables," the federal budget is a mountain of fat. As this series has detailed, program after program could be cut to the long-term benefit of even their intended beneficiaries. If the Grace Commission recommendations were enacted tomorrow, government services would be delivered more efficiently across the board. If Pentagon cuts pared bloated staffs, we would have a leaner and meaner military. Cutting subsidies would give us a stronger farm sector, better transportation and so on. While we hesitate to mention it when middle-class welfare has scarcely been dented, in many ways the poverty programs have proved a burden on the poor.The only "uncontrollable" has been Congress, locked in a mirage of "political reality" and structured into petty fiefdoms guaranteeing indiscipline and inertia. On this front, the 1985 session offers at least a glimmer of hope. Buoyed by the resounding defeat of the last New Deal Democrat, the Republican administration will present a budget that at least offers a menu of budget reductions. In Robert Dole, the Republican Senate has a new activist leader who will go beyond the consensus of his colleagues and try to make his own mark -- a positive development even if we disagree with some of his ideas. On the budget, political will is starting to bud.We fear, though, that these tender buds will be nipped in a fit of ignorance and misunderstanding. While there is now an inchoate recognition that the budget needs to be cut, there is no cogent rationale of why. This will both lead to a splintering of the potential political coalition, and focus attention on the least meaningful kind of savings. The problem is that no one actually talks about cutting expenditures. Instead, everyone talks only of cutting the deficit.This rhetoric is bound to raise the suspicions of the supply-siders, ourselves included, for it has historically been a code word for raising taxes. As Alan Reynolds records nearby, this is a proven prescription for stagnation of both the economy and the government. (See: "Less Will Get You More" -- WSJ Jan. 23, 1985) It has been fashionable lately to calculate how much economic growth would be needed to eliminate the deficit with no increase in taxes. No one bothers to calculate what it would take to eliminate the deficit by raising taxes with no economic growth, though this clearly would be even more "unrealistic"; nothing produces deficits like recession. In any anti-deficit strategy growth remains the key, and growth is not promoted by higher taxes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>CARACAS, Venezuela -- Just after the Mexican currency crisis broke in late 1994, Latin American borrowers had trouble finding anyone to lend them money even for a month or two.Now investors are scrambling to buy billions of dollars of Latin corporate bonds, some of which won't come due for 100 years. They are betting the region will snap out of a wave of recessions that have plagued it since the currency crisis. These lenders are counting on economic growth that will make it easy for companies to offer billions of dollars of new debt.Mexico's payment last week of the last part of its $13.5 billion emergency loan from the U.S. is likely to boost investor confidence in the region even more.Last Friday U.S. pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies, among others, snapped up an eye-popping $650 million bond offering from Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA, or Endesa, Chile's largest electric utility. The bond sale included $200 million of 100-year bonds, the first from Latin America. Demand was so strong for the investment-grade offering that it was increased from an original size of $580 million, says Bill Rogers, a vice president of debt capital markets at Chase Securities Inc., a subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Corp.The Endesa offering is just the latest sign of investor eagerness to lend to Latin companies, which sold a record $19 billion of bonds last year, according to IFR Securities Data Co.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bill Clinton did his best to look attentive at his economic summit yesterday, but to really understand what was going on the President-elect would have needed earphones with instant translation. How else could he, or anyone else, make sense of this economic tower of babble?That may seem harsh, but is there a theme we're missing here other than that the country's a mess and Mr. Clinton plans to do something about it? Opening the two-day conference, Mr. Clinton dusted off his campaign stump speech, which may have been only prudent since no conclave of 300 people is ever going to be more than a giant bull session. Some in the Clinton camp have thought this was a dumb idea from the start, which is at least reassuring. Their least-awful solution has been to make the event a kind of economic "Oprah," in which designees from all sides of the Clinton coalition get to explain how they feel about the economy.So we have economist Allen Sinai, who supports a cut in the capital gains tax, communing with MIT Keynesian Robert Solow, who wants to raise virtually every tax known to man. David Osborne, the "reinventing government" author, gets to schmooze with Ken Geiger of the teachers' unions, which think public schools with 50% drop-out rates deserve more money. Perhaps they'll all have a mind meld.Assorted small-business owners (such as the trendy folk at neo-prep clothier J. Crew), who are supposed to create all sorts of "high-wage jobs," get to mingle with Jessica Tuchman Mathews, who would saddle those same owners with new environmental rules that cost jobs. Our favorite name on the summit list, we have to admit, is Chief Wilma Mankiller, representing the "Cherokee Nation," though we hope not a feminist economic priority.Our own view, since Mr. Clinton is asking, is that the U.S. is not in fact in any economic crisis. The economy is now expanding, more slowly than we'd like, but enough so that any "short-term" stimulus would be counterproductive. If there is an economic emergency now, it's in Japan and Germany, which are both in recession and have long-term structural problems. Far from beating our brains out, Japan in particular might soon be asking the Clinton administration for financial help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OTTAWA -- Bank of Canada Governor John Crow is using his own "made-in-Canada" policy to deal with inflation: He wants none of it regardless of what happens south of the border.So when the U.S. prime rate fell last week, it was no surprise that the Canadian rate remained at a lofty 13.5% to keep inflation at bay."There is no God-given reason or law why we have to have inflation," says Mr. Crow, an extremely guarded man who watches his words closely even for a central banker. "I believe the underlying objective of monetary policy should be to provide currency that Canadians can have full confidence in. That means preserving the value of money. That means price stability. That means zero inflation."That also means conflict. Mr. Crow's uncompromising stand against inflation has pushed real Canadian interest rates to near record highs, bringing the central banker into conflict with politicians, economists, businessmen and almost everyone who owes money and must pay interest.Zero inflation "isn't an achievable goal," argues Don Blenkarn, chairman of the House of Commons finance committee. Trying to reach it would impose "horrendous" costs on the economy by stifling investment and expansion.</TEXT>

Those three quarters follow five quarters of steady or improving behavior, according to the survey, which is to be released today."Businesses are concerned about the recovery, and sometimes that means `I'm not going to pay as quickly as I have to,'" said Frank Lourenso, a Chemical Bank executive vice president in charge of the middle-market banking group. "People are trying to stay as liquid as possible."D&B's quarterly survey is based on payment records of one million companies as reported by their suppliers to Dun & Bradstreet Corp. The survey compares the length of time it takes companies to pay their bills relative to the year-earlier period.For the three months ended Sept. 30, the survey found that the number of companies taking longer to pay their bills exceeded the number paying more promptly by 7.2%. In the second quarter, the number of cash-hoarding companies exceeded the number of faster-paying companies by 6.2%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Federal Reserve's decision to continue one of the most audacious experiments in monetary history -- an $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program designed to boost growth -- followed six months of tense negotiations inside the central bank, and a stumbling effort to let the public know what was going on.A small group of Fed officials has been privately pushing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to plan an exit from his signature program, said several people familiar with the closed-door deliberations. But glimmers of a weakening economy prompted the Fed in September to keep the program going -- surprising markets primed by months of central-bank suggestions that a wind-down was nearing.The saga shows how hard it is for a central bank to communicate about plans that are complicated, evolving and conditional on the economy. Fed officials regard programs designed to sway long-term interest rates as essential to the fragile economy -- tools for stimulating consumer spending, investing and home buying. Mr. Bernanke has long argued that being more transparent will make such policies more effective.The Fed's efforts to telegraph its strategy left investors confused at key points about where it was heading, and some misread Mr. Bernanke's intentions about the bond-buying program and interest rates. That disconnect exacerbated a real-world problem: rising rates that by August showed signs of denting a budding housing recovery.At present, the Fed has laid the groundwork to start reducing its bond purchases later this year or early next year. But that depends on how the economy weathers another recent soft patch, which has been complicated by feuding between Congress and the White House over fiscal policy. More clues will appear Wednesday when the Fed releases minutes of its Sept. 17-18 meeting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Fourth in a Series]Economist Robert Hall has been puzzling over a thorny question for nearly a year: What do you call an economy that has started expanding again but keeps destroying jobs?Mr. Hall heads a committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research, an academic group in Cambridge, Mass., that declares when U.S. recessions begin and end. In May of last year, Mr. Hall and his colleagues believed the latest recession might be over. Consumers were spending more and economic output was rising. All that the committee members needed to see was a few months of uninterrupted job growth to announce the end of the recession. "It seemed like the timing was imminent," he says.But Mr. Hall is still waiting. Instead of expanding employment, companies are continuing to shed jobs at a furious pace -- 525,000 nonfarm payroll positions in the past three months alone. Since March 2001, when the recession began, the U.S. economy has lost 2.1 million jobs. The total number of people unemployed -- including discouraged workers who would prefer to work but have stopped looking -- is about 9.2 million. And the number of people who are working part time because they can't find full-time work is 4.8 million, up 46% since 2001, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In short, the U.S. is experiencing the most protracted job-market downturn since the Great Depression. It has left behind a remarkably broad swath of workers -- from young to old, and from high-school dropouts to the highly educated -- even as the economy has started growing again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The federal government opened its new fiscal year with a much bigger deficit than a year earlier, when it was operating on a reduced, temporary budget.The total budget deficit widened last month to $40.26 billion from $22.58 billion a year earlier, when the government faced shutdowns and budgetary stalemates. The deficit is the amount by which expenditures exceed receipts.In its monthly statement, the Treasury said receipts totaled $99.95 billion in October, compared with $95.67 billion a year earlier and $157.67 billion in September. Outlays totaled $140.21 billion last month, compared with $118.25 billion a year earlier and $122.24 billion in September. The October budget gap compared with a revised surplus of $35.43 billion in September.Separately, the Labor Department said the U.S. import price index, excluding fuels, fell 0.3% in October, marking the fifth monthly decrease for the index in the past six months. Import prices for nonpetroleum industrial supplies and materials, automotive vehicles, consumer goods and capital goods also posted modest declines in October. Only the index for foods, feed and beverages edged higher in the month, rising 0.1%.Overall, import prices rose 0.4% in October, bolstered by a 6.1% jump in petroleum prices after a 7.4% gain in September. Over the last 12 months, prices for imported petroleum have risen 37.6%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>VENTURE INVESTING in small firms continues on a downward spiral.Venture-capital funding for small companies plunged 66% in the first quarter, industry researchers report.Investments declined to $185 million from $539 million a year earlier, says Venture Economics Publishing Co., an industry research concern in Needham, Mass. The number of companies getting funds slid to 173 from 333. With the decline continuing in the second quarter, venture capital for small companies could sink below $1 billion for 1991, less than half 1990's $2.1 billion, Venture Economics says."The downward trend in venture investing has intensified," says David Schutt, editor in chief of Venture Economics. He says big institutions, disappointed by recent returns, are scaling back their involvement in venture funds. Only 15 venture-capital funds raised money from investors in the first half of this year -- a combined $541 million, off 43% from $954 million a year earlier.Analysts say the recession has also slowed the flow of money, as venture capitalists negotiate bargain prices for stakes in struggling concerns.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Conor DoughertyA key gauge of U.S. inflation has fallen to its lowest level since record-keeping began in 1957, underscoring the continued weakness in the economy.Consumer prices rose 0.2% in October compared with September, almost entirely because of higher energy costs, the Labor Department said Wednesday.When volatile food and energy are subtracted, prices were unchanged last month--the third straight month in which this so-called core measure of inflation was flat. Compared with a year ago, consumer prices other than food and energy have risen 0.6%.The drop in the core measure bolsters the Federal Reserve's case that inflation is so low--below its informal target--that it should resume its purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds to boost the economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices rose 0.5% last month, the Labor Department reported, a marked slowdown from their 1.1% surge in January but still disturbingly high to a number of economists.A record 18.7% drop in fuel-oil prices helped hold down the overall price level, but a sharp, 3.3% jump in clothing prices kept inflation higher than many analysts had hoped.The department's latest consumer price index, which measures the average change in the retail price of a fixed basket of goods and services, shows that the inflation rate seems to be recovering from a bitter cold-weather shock this winter. In January, catapulting food and energy prices drove the index up 1.1%, its largest monthly increase in more than seven years. The record drop in heating oil prices last month followed a 26.3% jump in January. Overall energy prices fell 0.7% in February after jumping 5.1% in January. Food prices, which soared 1.8% in January after the cold wave destroyed crops, grew 0.5% in February.Many economists said that despite the retreat from January's sharp advance, February still leaves inflation worrisomely high."I think this shows inflation is a very stubborn problem," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "There is simply no evidence as yet that the Federal Reserve has been able to bring down the core rate of inflation."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>CARTERET, N.J. -- Pathmark Stores Inc. said it posted a profit before reorganization and other items for the fiscal fourth quarter of $13.6 million, or 45 cents a diluted share, mainly because of the opening of new stores and renovation of existing locations.Including the reorganization and other items, the supermarket chain reported a net loss of $48.5 million, or $1.62 a share, for the period ended Feb. 3.For a year earlier, Pathmark posted a loss of $2.5 million, or eight cents a share.Results in the recent quarter are a combination of two different entities formed because of the company's emergence from Chapter 11 protection in September 2000.Sales for the period climbed 11% to $1.06 billion from $956.1 million. Aside from an extra week in 2000, a company spokesman said the increase was driven by strong holiday sales, the opening of four new stores and renovation of 19 stores in the Philadelphia and New York City metropolitan areas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For home buyers, 2012 was the year of the jumbo, jumbo mortgage.Private jumbo loans start after $417,000 in most parts of the country-- or exceed $625,500 in pricey metro areas like New York and San Francisco. But lenders say they've been doling out loans that far exceed these amounts."We see quite a bit of volume over $1 million . . . [which] did increase this year," says Brad Blackwell, portfolio business manager for Wells Fargo's home-mortgage unit.Overall, lenders distributed $148 billion of private jumbos over the first nine months of the year, up 23.3% from the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. Originations for the year are on pace to be the highest since 2007.The jumbo surge overlaps with a spike in luxury real-estate sales. For much of the year, sales of existing single-family homes priced at $1 million or more have been on the rise. In November, sales volume increased 52% from a year prior, according to the latest data by the National Association of Realtors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the depths of the credit crunch, community lenders became a popular financing source for Main Street. But small-business owners may need to work harder to get support from local banks these days.Even though most community banks came through the financial collapse in good health, with lots of capital and liquidity to extend loans, some of them have gone under. So, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies are increasing their scrutiny of local lenders to spot troubled assets and keep the banks in solid financial shape. As part of the effort, the watchdogs are asking the banks to boost their capital and loan-loss reserves even further--which means raising more money, getting more selective about making new loans and canceling the risky loans on their books.The upshot for business owners: Local bankers now demand a lot more information about the business and its operations before they sign off on a loan. Entrepreneurs who land a loan need to give frequent updates about the state of affairs--and not just routine financial information, such as sales figures.Bankers need deeper "information about what's going on with the business...for instance, if one of the [borrower's] customers is in financial trouble," says Kevin Tenpas, chief executive of Heartland Business Bank in De Pere, Wis., a part of Heartland Financial USA Inc. in Dubuque, Iowa.Small-business owners who don't work closely with their lenders will find it much tougher to get financing. "I think it's even more important to have that relationship now than before," says Mr. Tenpas. "I think the tendency is for owners to not communicate if it's not good news, which is when it's most important."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- New York's budget took another blow on Monday, as Congress pulled away from providing more than $1 billion in expected health-care funding. If the money doesn't show up soon, officials warn, there will be layoffs.Senate aides said Monday that a measure to extend unemployment benefits is likely to pass this week, but won't include the extra Medicaid money that Gov. David Paterson and Mayor Michael Bloomberg had been seeking to plug budget holes.In previous versions of the bill, the money had been included along with unemployment benefits. Now, Senate Democrats have decided the only way to get the unemployment bill passed is to strip out the other spending. Democrats had tried to gather enough support for a stripped-down version of the health-care funding measure, but even that did not have enough support.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) blamed lawmakers who "feel it is in their best political interest to obstruct everything right now, even critical medical assistance for communities in New York and across the country.""New York officials weren't giving up hope of getting the money in the next few months, but that possibility is receding fast as lawmakers, fearing the wrath of voters in an election year, retreat from most new spending proposals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Bond prices slumped yesterday after the Federal Reserve System reported an unexpectedly large increase in the nation's money supply.Prices of some actively traded Treasury bonds fell about 1/2 point, or around $5 for each $1,000 face amount. But most short-term interest rates were little changed.The basic money supply, known as M1, jumped $1.4 billion in the week ended Sept. 2, leaving it far above the Fed's target. The Fed also reported M1 soared at a 20.5% annual rate in August. Most analysts had expected little or no change in M1 in the Sept. 2 week.The $1.4 billion spurt "was a major disappointment," said Elliott Platt, senior vice president and economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. The growth of money is a "definite negative" for the credit markets, he said.With the economy showing signs of rebounding from a sluggish first-half performance, many analysts argue that the Fed may soon tighten credit conditions, pushing up interest rates, in an attempt to slow money growth. "If the economy continues to strengthen, the Fed will have to pay attention to the money supply," Mr. Platt said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Senate Finance Committee approved legislation to extend until next March emergency unemployment benefits that otherwise shut down July 4.Workers who have exhausted normal state unemployment benefits would be eligible for either 26 or 33 weeks of additional emergency benefits under the plan, depending upon the unemployment rate in their state. The number of weeks could be reduced, however, if the national unemployment rate, currently 7.5%, drops below 7% for two consecutive months.The finance panel's plan is far closer to administration proposals than the version passed Tuesday by House Democrats. The House bill would offer up to 26 weeks of emergency jobless benefits. Both jobless packages, however, face administrative opposition.The $5.4 billion cost of the legislation approved yesterday would be covered by eight tax-raising measures. One provision would require securities dealers to pay taxes on the year-end market value of their portfolios, rather than on the value at purchase. Another provision would bar new owners of failed thrifts from deducting losses for which the federal government has compensated them since March 4, 1991, a practice known as double-dipping.Both of these tax provisions were part of President Bush's budget proposal this year. Another measure would require large corporations to pay their quarterly taxes based on 96% of their estimated yearly income, up from 95%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BANGALORE - India's technology sector is bracing for a potential slowdown in growth after the historic U.S. credit downgrade over the weekend, which heightened fears of a double-dip recession in the largest outsourcing market and sparked a sell-off in IT stocks Monday.Indian technology companies earn more than 80% of their revenue from the U.S. and Europe. Coupled with a full-blown debt crisis looming over Europe, the Standard & Poor's downgrade of the U.S. debt rating is raising concerns of a return to the recessionary times of 2008, when the local software industry bore the brunt of lower spending by cash-strapped clients.The Bombay Stock Exchange technology index closed 4.3% lower Monday, leading the 1.8% downfall in the broader Sensex.The downgrade may lead to a slowdown in business in the immediate term, Shami Khorana, president of the Americas division of HCL Technologies Ltd., said late Sunday. Clients in the U.S. might feel cost pressures immediately and go slow in their spending decisions, Mr. Khorana added.Shares of HCL, the fourth largest India-listed software exporter by sales, closed down 5.8% at 419.00 rupees ($9.40) after touching their lowest level since December.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After five years on Easy Street, investors are in limbo, and stocks are no longer a sure thing.Since the Oct. 19 crash, stock prices have had trouble getting above 2000 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average again. And yesterday, in response to a slide in the dollar, the Dow tumbled 56.70 points to 1942.97. The broad effect of the October market rout, like other historic bear markets, seems to be in reviving habits of viewing stocks with less greed -- and more fear.Pre-crash talk of the Dow soaring to 3600 next year has evaporated. Instead, many money managers are hoping for a brief New Year's rally to enable them to unload money-losing debris. Even optimistic professionals see room for only modest gains in the next couple of years. Some are pulling back from stocks altogether, while others are avoiding the speculative stars of a few months ago. People still willing to buy equities are looking for export-oriented companies, battered growth stocks, or "defensive" issues that could hold up if a recession hits."The knowledge that stocks can fall so far, so fast" will change investment behavior for a long time, says Jeremy Siegel, a Wharton School finance professor.In addition, many people fear that another crash could entrench a bear market for years. Historians note that it wasn't the 1929 crash that killed the market nearly 60 years ago but a second collapse in 1930 that really clobbered stocks -- and the world economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TOKYO -- Japan announced broad tariff reductions including the elimination of tariffs on items such as auto parts and certain telephone equipment.But U.S. and Japanese officials said the impact of the reductions on Japan's trade surplus isn't likely to be large. What's more, they said Japanese officials are having trouble drafting a broader package of trade measures that is scheduled to be announced next month.Japanese officials said the latest tariff cuts are the broadest since a similar sweeping reduction in 1972. This time, tariffs were eliminated on 32 industrial products such as telephone exchanges, laminated automobile glass and aluminum airplane skins. Tariffs on about 1,800 further items were reduced about 20% each. The Japanese also announced a readiness to eliminate all tariffs on manufactured items if other leading industrial countries do the same. They said they currently are negotiating a reciprocal agreement with the U.S. to eliminate tariffs on computer equipment.Tokyo is trying to ward off anti-Japanese legislation threatened by the U.S. Congress. Japanese officials estimated that the tariff cuts could cost Japan as much as $400 million a year in lost revenue. They said the cuts required days of sometimes acrimonious infighting within the government and ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which is backed by business leaders and farmers here. But a U.S. official, asked whether the tariff cuts would affect the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, just laughed."It isn't going to have a significant effect," he said, noting that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is likely to swell to $50 billion this year from $37 billion last year.</TEXT>

"It was designed to deliver emotions and I don't think emotions have a party. There was zero political message. It was meant more of a rally cry to get together and what makes us strong is our collective power and not our individual disagreements."At issue is whether the ad's intent was to sell cars or to help President Barack Obama in this fall's presidential campaign.

In interviews, he bragged about having a special telephone number to receive an onslaught of calls. "If you want justice in the southland of Los Angeles, you wire 213-ARABIAN and you got me," he declared.In the staid judicial world, many decried what they saw as an affront to the dignity of the bench. They were also astonished by reports of the lucrative deal the retired justice had cut with the AAA, the nation's oldest provider of private justice.But the marketing of 61-year-old Justice Arabian ratcheted up what has become an intense battle among the AAA and its rivals to snag judges and the money they generate. "We're in the merchandise business," says Milton Adler, secretary-treasurer of Judicate of Philadelphia, an East Coast competitor. "Judges are like our inventory."Though retired judges around the country now resolve legal battles out of court, nowhere is the competition for them as intense as in California, where the practice took hold 17 years ago and has become more and more widespread. Cutbacks in court funding in recent years and the state's "three-strikes" sentencing law have created long waits for civil trials and unprecedented demand for court alternatives, especially mediation.

After five glorious years of 20%-plus annual returns, the widely watched Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last year sank 9.1% including dividends, its worst year since 1977. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 6.2%. And the technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market posted its steepest dive in history, shedding 39% while some Internet stocks fell much harder.The answer is that there is no single answer: No cookie-cutter solution fits all. It may well be time for people nearing retirement to cut back on stocks, but it wouldn't be smart to do it in one fell swoop. The right move for you depends on several factors, notably your age, your life expectancy and -- this is key -- whether you have enough cash on hand to avoid dumping stocks at low prices if you encounter more bad stock-market years immediately after you retire.To provide some guidance, Encore talked with a number of financial advisers who specialize in retirement.

    <TEXT>TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan, in a surprise announcement, said Friday it will lower the money-market interest rates it controls in an effort to boost economic growth.The central bank, in saying it would usher short-term market interest rates lower, didn't disclose a specific target. But immediately after the announcement, Japan's key short-term money-market rate was trading at 0.8%, a record low. By lowering the cost of money, the move will encourage new bank lending and growth.The move, which followed an announcement by the U.S. Federal Reserve that it would lower short-term interest rates, caused stock and bond prices to surge in Japan. At the end of the morning session Friday, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average was up 633.21 points, or 4.1%, to 15,890.10."This is a big, big move," said Marshall Gittler, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in Tokyo. A surge in bond prices caused the yield on the benchmark government bond, an interest rate that falls as the bond's price rises, to hit a record low of roughly 2.5% in trading late Friday morning.The move confirms the government is concerned that Japan's economy is teetering on the brink of recession. By one measure, gross national product, Japan already fell into a recession during the first quarter of this year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A piece of the New York Stock Exchange went public yesterday; the bulls didn't stampede.In fact, investors looking to the possible IPO of the entire Big Board itself hope it will make a bigger splash than yesterday's debut by LaBranche & Co., one of the pre-eminent Big Board floor-trading firms-so-called specialists -- and the first to complete an initial public stock offering.LaBranche, the third-largest specialist firm, offered its shares Wednesday night at $14 each, below the expected price range of $15 to $17. The company had filed 11.5 million shares, but sold just 10.5 million. Not only is LaBranche the specialist firm in charge of trading such blue chips as AT&T and Exxon, it is a firm that is an integral part of the world's most-famous trading floor.Specialists stand on the exchange's floor and match buyers and sellers of particular stocks and put up their own capital when necessary to ensure smooth trading.But the small-capitalization LaBranche IPO finished its first day of Big Board trading yesterday up just 3.5% over the offering price at $14.50 -- not exactly a big splash in an era of skyrocketing "dot-com" issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The aftermarket has been kind to many of August's underachieving new issues.Most of the companies that foundered when they launched their initial public offerings last month have found new life and many market watchers are pointing to this trend as a sign that, when the IPO market returns from its traditional summer slowdown this week, momentum is on its side."We've gotten a little bit of a reprieve from the selloff in August," said Kathy Smith, portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital's IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund in Greenwich, Conn. "Investors are still jittery, but they're definitely feeling better about the near term, and that's so important for the small-cap growth sector."This shift in sentiment is seen most clearly in many of the Internet IPOs that had struggled for most of August. Online recruitment company HotJobs.com Inc., for instance, sold 3 million shares at $8 each-below price estimates of $9 to $11and closed at $8 in its first day of trading on Aug. 10, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. The company's shares, though, closed Friday at $26.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Mortgage.com Inc. closed below its $8 offering price when it debuted Aug. 11, but now trades at $16.125 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.Even those companies that saw just modest gains in their opening days have had big increases. Homestore.com Inc. closed at $22.75 Aug. 4 after pricing 7 million shares, then barely broke 23 after its first week. The shares closed Friday at $49.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Likewise, Netscout Systems Inc. closed at $13.875, a healthy premium over its $11 offering price, when it debuted Aug. 12. But now the shares stand at $26.625 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With oil prices easing and the uncertainties of the election past, U.S. consumers show early signs of becoming more confident about the economic outlook.The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index -- based on surveys conducted before and after the Nov. 2 election -- rose to a reading of 95.5 from 91.7 in October and 94.2 in September. In addition to the drop of oil prices below $50 a barrel and the resolution of a bitterly fought presidential campaign, the government reported recently that hiring in October was stronger than expected, all factors that should underpin confidence."Consumers will remain spending-minded," said Richard Curtin, the Michigan economist who oversees the confidence survey. He said the recent decline in oil prices was probably the key factor behind the improvement.Households were spending-minded in October, though their pattern of spending showed signs of changing from the month before. The U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales in October rose 0.2% from September on a seasonally adjusted basis, after a 1.6% jump the month before. The back-to-back gains put household consumption on solid footing going into the holiday season.One retailer that enjoyed steady gains in spending was Men's Wearhouse Inc., a Houston seller of men's suits with an average price of about $280. The retailer reported a hearty 8.9% increase in domestic same-store sales last month from a year earlier. "Our business is kind of to the masses, to the middle-market kind of guy.

    <TEXT>Blackstone Group reached an agreement to restructure the balance sheet of Hilton Worldwide as it looks to improve the flagging fortunes of its single largest investment.Hilton's lenders and Blackstone are finalizing a deal that would cut its $20 billion debt load by about $4 billion, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. The agreement calls for Blackstone's funds to contribute $800 million of new equity, which will be used to buy back debt at a discount. It would also extend the maturity of some debt issues, these people said.The restructuring will help shore up Hilton's finances as it struggles through a downturn in the hotel industry. For months, some analysts have said there was a risk that Hilton might not be able to generate enough cash to stay current on its $20 billion of debt. Without a restructuring, Blackstone could have been forced to sell Hilton assets to cover its roughly $900 million in interest payments, according to the analysts.A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment.A number of large leveraged buyouts -- walloped by the economy and large debt loads -- have managed to stave off default over the past year by restructuring their balance sheets. They've been helped by high-yield markets, which have proven eager to snap up new debt of even the weakest credits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Consumer spending rose slightly in July as Americans swapped their old cars for new ones in a program meant to help steer the U.S. economy out of recession.Spending rose 0.2% compared with June and personal income was unchanged, the Commerce Department said Friday. Inflation wasn't threatening, a price gauge showed.The increase marked the third-straight month that spending climbed and reflected the effects of the federal "cash for clunkers" program, which let motorists swap gas-guzzlers for more fuel-efficient models. It began in late July and ended Monday.Outside of the clunkers program, consumer spending was still weak, underlining the challenges to an economic recovery. About three-quarters of the spending increase came from outlays for new vehicles. Economists expect the program to register a similar effect for August."The economy did not come into [the third quarter] like a ball of fire," said Ken Mayland, who runs ClearView Economics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- More than four years into the economic expansion, wage increases remain modest.The Labor Department said yesterday that total compensation costs rose just 2.9% in the 12 months ended in June. That's slightly less than the inflation rate of 3% during the same period. Wage and salary costs were just keeping up with inflation during the year ended in June, and benefit costs were up just 2.7%, the department's employment-cost index indicated. In the second quarter, compensation costs rose 0.7%, slightly more than the 0.6% gain registered in the first quarter. Compensation costs include wages or salary and benefits.There are several explanations for the sluggishness of compensation gains: international competition, the decline of labor unions, health-care cost containment, companies subcontracting their extra work and automation."Manufacturing and service companies have really elected to put the squeeze on what they pay their workers," says Stephen Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley & Co. "They've had to."The slow increase in compensation costs is all the more surprising when productivity increases are considered. Over the past few years, the trend in productivity growth has been about a half a percentage point more than it was in the 1970s or 1980s. Companies, meanwhile, have become fat with cash from the profits. "Within a year of a meaningful uptick in productivity, we should see a meaningful uptick in wages," Mr. Roach says.</TEXT>

Wolfensohn Inc., a New York investment banking firm, and teach part time at Princeton University.The choice of a small firm by the 60-year-old Mr. Volcker came as surprise to many on Wall Street, where big investment banks had been vying energetically for his services. "I had lots of discussions and offers from various firms," Mr. Volcker admitted. "I was very close to doing one or two other things."The winner in the Volcker sweepstakes was James D. Wolfensohn, 54, who set up the firm in 1981. Though widely known to Wall Street professionals, Mr. Wolfensohn has generally maintained a low profile. Before now, he has been most visible in the roles he played in the federal government's bailout of Chrysler Corp. and on CBS Inc.'s board.As an investment banker with Salomon Brothers in the 1970s, he served as a leading strategist in the successful effort to avert a bankruptcy-law filing by Chrysler, helping to engineer a controversial federal loan guarantee that played a crucial role in the rescue.

    <TEXT>It seems that postcommunist Russia poses a greater threat to global capitalism than the Soviet Union ever did. The Russian debt default in mid-August has generated financial shock waves that could drive next year's growth rate of the world economy to the lowest level in the postwar era. There are worrying signs that the U.S. will experience a credit crunch in the banking sector that could offset the benefits of lower interest rates. And while the European economy still enjoys moderate growth momentum, it will be highly vulnerable to an export slump if the rest of the world continues to slow.The magnitude of the correction after the Russian default illustrates how profoundly global financial markets have changed as new technology has driven down the cost of trading, hedge funds have gained access to leverage from bankers, and investors have developed an increasing appetite for risk following the long Wall Street boom. In turn, these changes have exposed how vulnerable the global financial system is, and underscored the need for an international lender of last resort.One vulnerability is the remarkable interdependence that has developed among markets because of the growth of global capital flows and the increasing role of highly leveraged investors in allocating capital. In the late 1980s, capital flows to developing countries were less than $50 billion. The Cold War's end and the growth of financial markets in developing countries drove this figure up to more than $300 billion in 1996.There has also been a dramatic expansion in the size of security markets. In the U.S., the ratio of stock-market capitalization to gross domestic product has nearly tripled during the 1990s while the mutual-fund industry now has greater assets than the banking system. The spectacular performance of the U.S. equity market stimulated an appetite for risk among high-income investors that encouraged a proliferation of new hedge funds. According to survey data, the U.S. now has more than 1,200 hedge funds with $200 billion to $300 billion in assets. During the 1990s these funds have become leading players in emerging markets.When Russia defaulted, it did not merely force some hedge funds to liquidate securities in other emerging markets. Instead, it produced such losses that many bankers felt compelled to curtail both their security market and their lending exposure in emerging markets. It also prompted some hedge funds to repay the low-cost yen loans they had taken out to finance security purchases and thus encouraged a large rally in the yen. Before August, few investors would have expected a Russian default to shatter Latin America's access to credit or produce a surge in the value of the yen, but such are the consequences of today's new global financial integration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON--The number of new applications for jobless benefits rose last week to the highest level since June, but stayed near prerecession lows.Initial claims for unemployment benefits increased by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 315,000 in the week ended Sept. 6, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims for the previous week were revised higher to 304,000.Last week's claims level was well above the 300,000 forecast by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, though it was possibly distorted by the Labor Day holiday. A Labor Department analyst noted that claims, a proxy for layoffs, tend to be especially volatile around holidays.The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, was up 750 to 304,000. It has been trending higher since hitting a 2014 low of 293,750 in early August. But that is still well below the average for the first half of the year and remains at levels last consistently seen before the recession."The claims data show clear improvement in labor-market conditions over the past few months, but some modest deterioration over the most recent few weeks," said J.P. Morgan Chase economist Daniel Silver.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Industrial production fell in December for the third consecutive month, offering bleak news on the state of America's smokestack economy.The 0.2% drop last month followed declines of 0.2% in November and 0.1% in October, the Federal Reserve Board said. A string of strong growth numbers last spring and early summer had seemed to indicate that the industrial sector was recovering, but the more recent figures from the Federal Reserve cast doubt on that."This is not a free fall," said Stuart Hoffman, senior economist for PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh, referring to a term President Bush used last week in New Hampshire to describe the economy. "But industrial production was a source of strength for the economy last spring, and now it is a source of weakness."Most of the decline in industrial production last month stemmed from a 3% drop in output of utilities; unusually warm weather reduced demand for electricity. Factories posted an 0.1% gain in output after declining 0.3% the month before. The auto industry, struggling to cope with excess inventories, cut output of cars and trucks 2.3%.Mr. Hoffman predicted that autos will continue to be a source of problems in the first quarter and will drag industrial production figures down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Alfred Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and one of the Fed's most independent voices on monetary policy, plans to retire on Aug. 1."It has been a great privilege to serve the Federal Reserve, and, most importantly, the public in this role," Mr. Broaddus said. He turns 65 in July, when Fed policy requires its bank presidents to retire.He has led the Richmond Fed since Jan. 1, 1993, and has been on the bank's staff since 1970. He is currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary-policy panel.Mr. Broaddus's shifting views on the risks of inflation and deflation have symbolized a transformation in the entire central bank. After becoming Richmond Fed president, he became one of its staunchest inflation "hawks," repeatedly dissenting from his colleagues to press for higher interest rates to stem inflationary pressure. But beginning a few years ago, he concluded the Fed had finally reached its goal of price stability and began to worry that the Fed might be slow to recognize the risk of deflation, or falling prices."In the past year, Mr. Broaddus has traveled an interesting path from being a well-known and fierce inflation hawk to being one of the Fed's most prominent warriors about the dangers of deflation," said Tom Schlesinger, executive director kept of the Financial Markets Center, a Virginia-based Fed watchdog group. "I think it reflects well on him that he's taken this intellectual journey and done so in public."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>GOODBYE, WASHINGTON. Hello, Wall Street.I am not a political columnist, and I have no desire to argue over the merits of privatizing Social Security. Still, for those of us who are investment junkies, it's time to start paying attention, because it looks as if this thing could actually happen.Which brings me to today's question: What would privatization mean for our finances? Here are three insights.-- Betting on bonds. When pundits discuss privatizing Social Security, there's much talk of Americans investing their payroll taxes in stocks. But if folks are logical, they will end up owning more bonds.After all, when we contribute to Social Security today, what we are buying is a future stream of inflation-indexed income, not unlike we could get by purchasing inflation-indexed Treasury bonds. Indeed, because we know we will get this income stream, presumably we are a little more aggressive with our individual retirement accounts, our 401(k) plans and our other retirement savings.</TEXT>

Arlen Specter could face defeat in Tuesday's Democratic primary, despite the president's support.The president declined to make a last-ditch appearance in Pennsylvania to rally Democratic voters to Sen.

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The economy continues to edge higher, and the consensus forecast is that the gains will continue, at least through 1988. The stock market, which moved upward last year mainly because of lower interest rates, now seems to be focusing mainly on an expectation of better corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the dollar is showing new weakness, the budget deficit isn't sinking very much, and a revival of inflation begins to look like a realistic possibility.That's more or less the situation the Federal Open Market Committee will confront next month as it meets to plan monetary policy for 1987. What will the committee decide to do?It may not matter very much. Last February the FOMC decided that M1, the narrowly defined money supply, should grow at a rate between 3% and 8% in 1987. In July the committee reaffirmed that range but also said that growth in excess of 3% to 8% would be "acceptable." It's a good thing the committee left itself some leeway, since the actual growth rate was about 17%.But the committee, whose voting members are the Federal Reserve governors and five of the regional Reserve Bank presidents, is required by law to say something. Composing the statement will be a little more difficult than usual this time, since the Fed seems to have gotten itself into a box.Through last year the Federal Reserve was under pressure from the Reagan administration to force interest rates lower, depreciate the dollar and stimulate economic growth. Chairman Paul Volcker made occasional noises to the effect that a falling dollar could be inflationary, but by and large the Fed went along. After all, the consumer price index last year rose at an annual rate of 1.1%, so why worry about inflation?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For Democrats, $30 billion seems to be the magic number.It's the amount Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both say is needed to stimulate the economy out of its doldrums. (Coincidently, it was the financial backing that the Federal Reserve originally offered for the Bear Stearns deal, before trimming it by $1 billion.) Sen. Obama laid out his economic plan today, and it helped sharpen policy differences between the two Democratic rivals, as well as Republican candidate John McCain. The stimulus prescription, it seems, is the political divider. Of course, both parties have already voted through a much larger $152 billion stimulus plan. That measure was designed to get people spending and businesses investing, however. The monies the two Democrats suggest adding to the pot would go toward battling the fallout from the housing crunch. Sen. Clinton's $30 billion would mostly go to help states and cities buy foreclosed properties. Mr. Obama has the same idea, but he would dedicate $10 billion of his stimulus to helping states head off cuts in services as tax revenues decline and to expanding unemployment insurance.On the Republican side, Sen. McCain has sworn off using government money for bailouts, although he backed the Bear Stearns deal as a fix to "systemic financial problems." He also doesn't approve lowering the down-payment requirements for Federal Housing Authority-backed loans as a way to help low-income homeowners. On the contrary, he wants to raise them. Sens. Obama and Clinton can agree on very little these days, but they have united in dismissing Sen. McCain's policy as fiddling while Rome burns. Sen. Clinton revived her "3a.m. phone call" image that she had used in an attack ad on Sen. Obama, and applied it to Sen. McCain: "The phone is ringing, and he would just let it ring and ring." In his speech, Mr. Obama said Sen. McCain's plan "amounts to little more than watching this crisis happen." Sen. McCain struck back in a statement before Sen. Obama's speech had even ended. "There is a tendency for liberals to seek big government programs that sock it to American taxpayers while failing to solve the very real problems we face," he said. Sen. McCain agrees with his opponents in some areas. Like them, he thinks mortgage companies should do more to help cash-strapped but creditworthy borrowers with their loans.---Oil Pipeline Struck in Iraq</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's nominees to the Federal Reserve Board stressed the importance of fighting a weak economy, indicating support for policies aimed at reducing the high unemployment rate."Over the next few years, the Fed must craft policies that ensure that our economy accelerates its progress along the recovery path it has begun to trace," Janet Yellen, the nominee for Fed vice chairman who has served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco since 2004, told the Senate Banking Committee. "With unemployment still painfully high, job creation must be a high priority of monetary policy."Ms. Yellen appeared at a confirmation hearing Thursday alongside two other nominees to become Fed governors: Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Peter Diamond and Maryland financial regulator Sarah Bloom Raskin.If confirmed to the seven-member Fed board, the trio would likely push the balance of power at the Fed toward those who worry more that the economy isn't expanding quickly enough rather than those worried about the risk of unwelcome inflation.Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) noted that recent data suggested that the economy was moving toward price deflation. "It is evident that the economy is going to need all the help the Fed can provide over the coming year," he said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oddsmakers give the recession a short duration. Even dour Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has detected a few signs of early recovery. But not everyone is yet convinced.Clearly, stock and bond investors have hedged their bets: All the averages are way below their optimistic thresholds. The bankruptcies of Enron, Kmart, Global Crossing and others have cast serious doubt about the sustainability of recovery. And lingering in the background is always the threat of another terrorist attack, Mideast war, or Third World currency collapse.As Joseph Stiglitz, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and later chief economist for the World Bank, warned way back in November, this recession might turn out to be the worst in 20 years. As Professor Stiglitz sees it, a deep recession like 1981-82 is the best we can hope for. In that 16-month recession, output fell by 12.3% and unemployment soared to a post-war high of 10.8%.By contrast, in the 1990-91 recession, output fell only 2.3% and unemployment peaked at 6.5%. That is the kind of short, shallow recession the optimists are hoping for this time around.Despite the spate of warning signs, the optimistic outlook still remains strong. The optimists' case rests not only on the usual array of indicators -- rising consumer confidence, abnormally low inventories, cheap money, and fiscal stimulus -- but also on a wild card few observers have noticed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange received long-awaited regulatory approval to trade Japanese stock-index futures, the first foreign stock index products approved for trading in the U.S.The unanimous approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission follows more than a year in which the contract applications were held in regulatory limbo. After last year's stock market crash, stock and futures regulators put all foreign stock-index futures applications on hold as they weighed the impact of the crash on financial markets here and abroad.The futures exchanges, which are also courting Japanese institutions to increase their trading of U.S. futures contracts, said they didn't expect to begin trading the Japanese stock-index contracts until early to mid-1989. The contracts will be settled in Japanese yen, a new feature for futures traded here.CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm said at a commission meeting in Washington that the newly approved contracts "respond to the increasing commercial interest in risk-management strategies" aimed at hedging against losses on international stock portfolios.A CFTC staff report on the contracts took the unusual step of putting into print widely held suspicions in the U.S. about the ability of large Japanese institutions to manipulate their stock market. The staff said there have been "some concerns about the potential for manipulation of individual Japanese stocks." But it said the design of the indexes, along with certain regulatory steps taken by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will make manipulation difficult.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the more important deficit-reducing events of the 1980s was the Social Security reform of 1983. The Social Security system is now running sizable surpluses that are being used to help meet federal deficit targets under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. The Social Security surplus thus masks the seriousness of the deficit problem in the rest of government.For this reason, many propose that deficit targeting be altered. They would target the rest of the government's deficit and move Social Security completely off-budget. While I am in strong agreement with the goals of the reformers, I worry that they are pursuing their goals with a highly risky mechanism.Following such a change, increases in Social Security benefits would no longer count against the official budget deficit. Given the strong political support for Social Security, the removal of budget discipline from the system would create an enormous temptation for politicians to spend some of the accumulated surplus. There is a long list of claimants and many expensive proposals have been made to correct perceived inequities in the system.Having allowed Social Security completely off-budget, it would be hard not to extend the same privilege to other trust funds. For example, the Medicare and civil-service pension trust funds would have a particularly strong claim to off-budget status. Both programs have contributed significantly to deficit reduction in the recent past. But if allowed off-budget, they are unlikely to do so in the future.More important, the Social Security benefit structure itself should not be allowed to escape budget scrutiny forever. Formidable political forces are now arrayed against any restraint on benefit growth, and Social Security is far from the political bargaining table. But that has not always been true, and there are reasonable options that would save many billions of dollars in the long run.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Q: What exactly is the budget deficit, and what harm does it do?Bill ShearerHanahan, S.C.Charleston Post and CourierA: The budget deficit was $412 billion, or 3.6% of the nation's gross domestic product, for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That's the grand tally of all the money the U.S. government takes in versus all the money it spends, including Social Security payroll taxes and benefits. (If you exclude Social Security, as some people like to do, the rest of the government ran $568 billion in the red.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Kelly EvansRetail stocks are starting to mount a comeback. But investors shouldn't expect the rally to last.The S&P Retail Index is up nearly 8% from its early July lows, amid some hopeful data from retailers. On Wednesday, for example, Macy's Inc. is expected to turn in solid second-quarter results. The department-store chain has already reported that sales at stores open a year or more posted year-on-year gains of 7.3% in July and 4.9% for the quarter as a whole.And on Friday, the Commerce Department is expected to say retail sales rebounded to gain 0.4% in July after slipping in May and June. That would put sales up by about 5.4% since July 2009.This is all reassuring for investors. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's signal Tuesday that it would keep interest rates at near-zero levels and purchase government debt to stimulate the economy should be a favorable backdrop for cyclical sectors like retail.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wanted: small investors willing to commit part of their savings to less-developed countries with fast-growing economies and the potential for big returns.That, in essence, is the pitch of the first U.S. mutual fund that invests primarily in the government bonds of so-called frontier markets.Launched in late February by American Beacon Advisors Inc., an investment firm in Fort Worth, Texas, with $55 billion under management, this fund takes investors to countries such as Venezuela and Rwanda that are one notch lower in economic development than emerging markets like India and China. The mutual fund is managed by Global Evolution, a hedge fund in Denmark.The push into frontier markets is the latest effort by money managers to make high-risk, high-return bets more accessible to mom-and-pop investors. Individuals in the U.S. already have the option of investing in a handful of stock funds dedicated to frontier markets.Some wealth advisers argue that small investors may be better served putting their retirement savings into more-transparent investments. Even American Beacon advises that its new fund is only appropriate for long-term investors and that the fund shouldn't make up the majority of a portfolio.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DON'T BE DAUNTED by the portentous title of the Court TV film "On Native Soil: The Documentary of the 9/11 Commission" (Aug. 21, 10 p.m. to midnight). With some exceptions, particularly its heavy-handed portrayals of some of the bereaved (Susan Rescorla, widow of Rick Rescorla, the heroic Morgan Stanley vice president for security, would certainly have cause for complaint), the documentary succeeds in making sense out of an impossibly complicated network of themes.The main one -- the work of the 9/11 Commission -- has, it should be said, been cleaned up significantly. There are no pictures here of the political grandstanding that marred that event, nothing of the semihysterical accusations of former Sen. Bob Kerrey, among others. Though we do get a telling moment in which former Watergate prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste, in full prosecutorial mode once more, refuses -- as though he were grilling an opponent before a jury -- to allow then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice to finish her answer. The bullying effort didn't prevent the witness from shutting Mr. Ben- Veniste up long enough to finish her answer -- one of her better public moments.It is wonderful, too, to hear former Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta declaiming against failures to strengthen airport security: Norman Mineta, militant foe of any special scrutiny of, say, passengers whose appearance and background fit the known profile of potential hijackers -- i.e., young Middle Eastern males. Especially those with odd omissions in their credentials.There's little doubt that Secretary Mineta's high-minded refusal to allow such passengers to be inconvenienced by extra questioning raised fears of giving offense among airport security staffers -- and gave rise to inhibitions that played their part in certain peculiar, and deadly, oversights. One such traveler who arrived at an airport without a photo ID was, as one of the film's commentators acidly points out, nevertheless allowed to proceed. The day was 9/11, that passenger one of the hijackers. Two other hijackers set off metal detectors and were allowed to proceed, without further search.Interwoven with the story of the hearings are the memories of survivors and of the bereaved, some of them never before heard, all of them haunting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no quick fix for the Tokyo stock market, Japanese and U.S. money managers say. Despite a small recovery last week, they predict the Tokyo market will fall further before it hits bottom. Still, they spy some bargains glittering amid the wreckage.The Nikkei index of 225 leading companies that trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has bounced back 4% in the past four trading days to 17450.52. But Don Krueger, a portfolio manager at Templeton International in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., thinks it has a lot further to fall."I see it going down to 11000 to 12000 in some kind of a panic sell-off as people finally throw in the towel," he says. "In falling markets, you typically see" that kind of selling "before a market bottoms. We haven't seen this in Tokyo yet."So far this year Japanese shares have plummeted 24%, and the Nikkei index is a whopping 55% below its record of 38915.87, set on the last day of trading in 1989.Yet big money manager Fiduciary Trust Co. International last week decided not to increase its already-small holdings of Japanese shares. Anne M. Tatlock, executive vice president in charge of institutional global equity investment, says the firm is deterred by Japan's slowing economy, expectations of poor Japanese corporate earnings and slow world economic growth, which portends mediocre business for Japanese exporters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- With the ink still wet on a $152 billion government economic-rescue plan, the White House rejected hints from Democrats that more emergency measures may be needed to keep the economy from entering a recession.President Bush is expected to sign the initial stimulus plan as early as tomorrow. The combination of tax rebates for individuals and investment incentives for businesses cleared both houses of Congress last week. It would also extend the reach of the Federal Housing Administration's home-loan program."We think that's an effective stimulus," Edward Lazear, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said yesterday of the initial plan. "We think it will have the desired effect. We still think that policy is appropriate, and we'd stick with that."Democratic lawmakers have suggested that they might push for further steps to accelerate economic growth and cushion the blow of a slowdown. Efforts could include an extension of unemployment benefits, an expansion of food stamps and an increase in federal spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure."Economists believe that this legislation will make a real difference in mitigating our current downturn," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nevada) said of the initial plan. "However, it is far from a panacea, and much more should be done to address our economy's longer-term problems."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- U.S. government bond prices edged lower yesterday in lackluster trading.Some long-term Treasury issues declined by about 1/4 point, or around $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount of securities. Government bond prices had risen more than 1 3/4 points in the previous two trading days.Yesterday's setback partly reflected a decline by the dollar in the foreign-exchange market and a slight rise in oil prices. Corporate bond prices rose despite a flurry of new issues. Municipal bond prices also moved higher.Investment managers generally continue to expect interest rates to fall in coming months. They expect the economy to remain sluggish, prompting the Federal Reserve to ease credit soon."The economy will be weak this year," said Elliott Platt, senior vice president and economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. He predicts business activity will grow 1 1/2% to 2% after inflation this year, compared with about 2.6% in 1986.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Long after acute needs for food, water, shelter and medicine are met, survivors of the Asian tsunami may suffer an invisible but disabling illness -- post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD -- that could complicate physical and economic recovery in the stricken regions.Millions now are suffering acute shock and depression after witnessing the sea swallow their relatives and homes. For some -- estimates range widely from 10% to 50% of survivors -- traumatic stress and major depression could last months or years, preventing the return to work, school or family duties.Watching a mate or child drown while being helpless to save them "can haunt a person for the rest of their life," says Ronald Kessler, professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School and director of the World Health Organization's World Mental Health surveys."Mental disorders of the sort that are likely to occur as a result of the tsunami can lead to averages of 20 days or more of lost productivity per year among working people," says Dr. Kessler, extrapolating from U.S. studies. Others won't be able to return to work for longer periods, he adds, with still graver impact on a developing-country economy.The WHO is offering quick courses in disaster mental-health training to Sri Lankan medical students, he adds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ROLAND, Okla. -- The bill collector called when Clay Stanley, gaunt and suffering from AIDS, lay bedridden in his apartment, back from the hospital after a bout with a viral infection.It wasn't about a car or credit card. The call concerned a matter Mr. Stanley, who is 39 years old, says he had long forgotten: student loans he took out two decades before. The private collector, acting on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education, said Mr. Stanley must pay $69 a month or the government would take a larger sum than that each month from his Social Security disability checks, Mr. Stanley recalls. "I didn't know what to do, so I said 'OK,' " he says.Years after a political outcry over high levels of student-loan defaults, the Education Department has become one of the toughest debt collectors around. Over the past decade, it has won a steadily expanding arsenal to wield against former students who don't repay.A 1998 change in federal law, for instance, made it extremely difficult for people to escape student loans through personal bankruptcy. The Education Department also can now seize parts of borrowers' paychecks, tax refunds and Social Security payments without a court order, a power that only the Internal Revenue Service, among federal agencies, regularly wields. Access to a government database of the newly employed has enabled the department to make much more effective use of private collection companies. And it can go after even decades-old student loans, because there's no statute of limitations on them, unlike most consumer debt.As a result, the Education Department collected $5.7 billion in defaulted student loans in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, more than twice as much as in 1998. For current loans that go into default, the department now projects it will ultimately retrieve every dollar of principal, plus almost 20% in fees and overdue interest, a prediction few private lenders would be bold enough to make.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON--U.S. regulators said Wells Fargo & Co. has convinced them that the financial system could avoid serious damage if the bank were to ever collapse, giving it a passing grade that ratchets up the pressure on other big banks slammed for producing unrealistic bankruptcy plans a few months ago.The San Francisco-based lender graded better than its peers Tuesday on its plan for a theoretical bankruptcy, but it still doesn't have the top score regulators would like to see.The bank declined to comment.The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said a hypothetical bankruptcy plan submitted by Wells Fargo "provides a basis for a resolution strategy that could facilitate an orderly resolution under bankruptcy" but said the blueprint still had some shortcomings that must be addressed when the bank files a revised plan in 2015. The agencies didn't specify the shortcomings. "Resolution" is shorthand for the process of unwinding a failing firm.The results are the latest indication that regulators favor simplicity. Though it is one of the largest bank holding companies in the U.S. by assets, Wells Fargo has a simpler structure than other conglomerate financial firms. Compared to peers like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo has a relatively small broker-dealer business and a relatively small international footprint. Much of its operations take place in its FDIC-insured banking subsidiary.</TEXT>

A consumption-based inflation measure, which is reported with a one-month lag, showed that prices paid by consumers were rising at a 0.6% rate in both July and August.

At the end of the European session it was 0.2% higher against the dollar at $1.3777. It remains not far below the 212-year high of almost $1.40 hit early this month.

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The credit markets took a breather yesterday after a strong rally late Wednesday.Most interest rates wound up little changed in quiet activity. Bond prices fell slightly as the Treasury sold $7 billion of new 10-year notes in another in a string of auctions scheduled until Thanksgiving.The average annual yield on the Treasury notes was 9.54%. That was down from 10.6% at the previous auction of similar notes held Aug. 7 and was the lowest since May 1979.Traders paid little attention to a Federal Reserve System report late yesterday that showed the basic money supply rose $1.5 billion in the week ended Nov. 11. The increase in the money measure, known as M1, was roughly in line with forecasts of most analysts in several surveys earlier this week.Wednesday's bond market rally was sparked by speculation that Congress finally will approve legislation designed to force large budget cuts soon and balance the budget by 1991. The credit markets' outlook depends heavily on what happens to that proposed legislation, according to Elliott Platt, senior vice president and economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good morning from New York,The U.S. economy is improving and the unemployment rate is falling, but we report on what seems to be a fixed feature of our new economy. More than one in six prime-working-age men doesn't have a job--a chronic condition that, economists say, shows how technology and globalization are transforming the job market faster than many workers can adapt. In a society that has long venerated work, the bleak prospects for the long-term unemployed--who aren't included in the unemployment rate if they stop actively searching for work--has been raising concern among policy makers and economists. We tell the stories of family men who never recovered from the recession, young people who have put major life events on hold and others for whom the job market might have passed them by.The Obama administration is revising its contentious drone program in Pakistan. We report that senior U.S. officials have told their Pakistani counterparts that they will narrow the program to target a finite short-list of known terrorists and aim to eventually end it before the conclusion of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's current term. Pakistani officials have long complained that the CIA keeps a rolling list of terrorist targets, making the program self-perpetuating. The revision, we find, reflects not only Pakistani objections to the strikes but logistical constraints on the CIA as U.S. troops are expected to pull out of Afghanistan at the end of 2014. We note, however, that strikes may continue if Afghanistan approves a security pact to keep U.S. troops in the country longer.Is it hypocritical for a business aimed at maximizing health outcomes to sell cigarettes? The second-largest pharmacy chain in the U.S. has decided it is. In an unprecedented move, CVS said on Wednesday that it plans to stop selling all tobacco products nationwide by October. "Cigarettes have no place in an environment where health care is being delivered," said the company's CEO. Our story looks at what the move means for the $100 billion tobacco industry as it struggles with slumping sales and widening smoking bans, and for CVS as it attempts to evolve from a drugstore into a health-care company. We also consider the million-dollar question of whether other retailers will follow CVS's example.The arrest of Charles Shrem, one of the best-known bitcoin advocates, is a setback to the popular currency that has been raising concern among regulators and governments. We profile the 24-year-old founder of a popular website that allowed users to buy and sell bitcoin, who faces legal troubles in connection with his currency exchange and an online black market. We find that his arrest underscores the challenges faced by bitcoin and its supporters as they try to expand the currency's influence. Despite his legal predicament, Mr. Shrem remains hopeful: "2014 will be like the Industrial Revolution for bitcoin," he said in an interview on Wednesday, while serving house arrest.</TEXT>

And the stock market, despite a sluggish economy, has risen to near-record levels.The average stock in the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index sells for a price/earnings multiple (P/E) of 20 times the past four quarters' earnings, way above the long-term average of 14 or so. The P/E of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is even higher, at 23.To bulls, low interest rates and low inflation justify today's high prices.

The Internal Revenue Service has about 2,400 people staffing its phone-in taxpayer information service.Want to be confident that the answer you get is correct? Then you might want to look somewhere else.This reporter called 17 IRS offices around the country to sample their answers to four questions taxpayers might ask between now and April 15. The questions ranged from a general inquiry about a new tax credit for diesel-car owners to a more demanding one about the tax treatment of a stock-market maneuver.The results: No question commanded correct answers from all five IRS offices to which it was directed. On two questions, four out of five responses were accurate. On the other two, totally or partially wrong answers outnumbered the correct ones by about the same ratio.Accountants say that such errors aren't unusual, particularly when somewhat complex questions are involved.

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The stock market turned lower after three days of gains, with volume on the New York Stock Exchange shrinking by 16% from the previous day.The lethargic session, analysts and traders said, showed that the 61.35-point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average the previous three days probably wasn't the start of a long rally. The industrial average fell 11.92 yesterday to 2141.71 as investors continued to take profits on the gains made early in the week. That tendency had begun to show up Wednesday, when the average rose only 4.27 points after a two-day advance totaling 57.08.Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit and other developments early in the week lifted the financial markets. But as Mr. Gorbachev cut short his New York visit and rushed home yesterday to deal with the effects of a serious earthquake in Armenia, bearish factors such as the U.S. budget deficit and possibly rising interest rates were back on center stage.Stock-index futures traders, meanwhile, continue to insist that the stock market won't really boil until the 280 level on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is broken. They had hoped that would happen yesterday. But the index, which had been rising strongly in recent days, never got above its opening level of 278.13. It closed at 276.57, down 1.56."Stocks are at a stopping point here for a few sessions, based on a normal easing of momentum," said A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research in New York. "There could be a pullback of 20 to 40 points (in the industrial average) over the next few days before it goes higher."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>REAL-ESTATE INVESTORS may want to consider "clustering."That's one of the ideas being proposed in a new report by Prudential Real Estate Investors, the real-estate investment and advisory business of Prudential Financial Inc. The report aims to provide guidance on how to diversify a commercial real-estate portfolio more effectively.Conventional wisdom in the real-estate industry has been that diversification simply means having property in as many markets as possible or in every region. That way, when one market underperforms, it is offset by another market that is doing well.Prudential Real Estate Investors offers an alternative way of thinking about diversification -- one that isn't new but is gaining more mainstream acceptance. It proposes grouping the nation's 35 major metropolitan areas into clusters. Economic characteristics, geographic proximity and size all play a role in the clustering, with a strong focus on what the different markets share in common. Markets that have similar industries, for instance, are lumped into clusters rather than regions. The theory is that clustering and limiting investing to a few markets within a cluster reduces risk and redundancy in a portfolio.Investors could decide, for instance, that instead of being in Boston, San Francisco, Raleigh, N.C., and Austin, Texas, which are all tech-heavy markets, they can be in just two of those markets and that will be enough tech exposure.</TEXT>

This makes a one-size-fits-all monetary policy more difficult to practice and pits the interests of small, higher-inflation countries against those of the large nations that would likely benefit from lower rates.At today's meeting, the ECB will weigh whether the bad news on the economy warrants a shift in focus from fighting inflation to supporting growth, a move that could by extension aid the U.S. and global economy. Over the past month, further evidence of a halting recovery has continued to pour in. Just yesterday, Germany reported that orders to its manufacturing industry fell a monthly 2.5% in September, dimming the prospects of Europe's largest economy. And in France, the region's second-largest powerhouse, industrial demand fell in the third quarter of this year, and a survey showed that business executives expect a further drop in the fourth. The Fed's decision also underscores the weakness of the U.S. economy, which Europe traditionally counts on to pull it out of a slump.Already this year, the ECB did an about-face on its attitude toward inflation. During the summer, the bank was gearing up to raise borrowing costs but had to quickly retract that plan as the recovery and stock markets faltered. Still, during the past few days, public statements from ECB officials suggested the 18-member governing council hadn't yet reached an agreement to cut rates as early as today. The ECB has surprised markets before, however.Some economists believe that if the ECB holds rates steady today, it will simply postpone the inevitable, miss a chance to appear proactive, and come under fire from the politicians, banks and media. "What do they win or lose by waiting another four weeks?" said Julian von Landesberger, an economist with HVB Group in Munich. "Until now the ECB was much too optimistic with regard to growth next year."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MONTREAL -- Air Canada pilots went on strike, disrupting air transportation across Canada and into the U.S. several days into a similar walkout by pilots at Northwest Airlines.But Canada's biggest airline and its 2,100 striking pilots weren't far apart in their terms when negotiations broke off shortly before midnight Tuesday. With passengers scrambling for scarce seats on other carriers and the Montreal company losing millions of dollars for every day the strike lasts, some analysts said they expect the stoppage to end within days.Spokesmen for Air Canada and its pilots' union said yesterday they were prepared to return to the bargaining table quickly, though further talks hadn't yet been scheduled.As with the Northwest Airlines strike in the U.S., the Air Canada dispute stems from labor concessions in the early 1990s. The Air Canada pilots argue that a pay cut they took in 1993, combined with subsequent productivity increases, helped the carrier post a record profit last year. The pilots also claim they are paid 30% to 50% less than pilots for major U.S. carriers.Talks broke down late Tuesday night with the pilots seeking a 12% pay increase over two years and the company offering a 9% increase over that period. While the difference amounts to only about seven million Canadian dollars (US$4.5 million) annually, Air Canada officials said they are concerned about the precedent for talks with other unions whose contracts will be up for negotiation in coming months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The U.S. dollar turned in another record-shattering performance yesterday, setting new highs against the British pound and the French franc and setting an 11 1/2-year high against the West German mark for the third consecutive day.In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 2.9550 marks, ahead of the Wednesday record level of 2.9535. It also advanced to 9.0625 French francs, from Wednesday's record of 9.0590 francs. The pound declined still further, to $1.2834 from the previous low of $1.2837, also set on Wednesday."Even those of us in the strong dollar camp," said Nicholas Sargen, a vice president of Salomon Brothers. Inc., New York, "are surprised at how strong the dollar is." Traders said the dollar's strength yesterday -- which occurred despite a decline in long-term U.S. interest rates; an unexpected decline in M1, the basic U.S. money supply measure, and some limited profit-taking from the currency's advances earlier this week -- almost surely means the dollar will shortly test the critical three-mark level.Any decline in U.S. interest rates hurts the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments look less attractive. Short-term U.S. interest rates, however, were relatively unchanged yesterday. Declines in M1 tend to hurt the dollar by easing pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten credit conditions, which can lead to upward pressure on interest rates. But the decline in M1 in the latest reporting week was only $700 million; the market had generally expected an increase of about $500 million.In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 244.60 yen from 244.05 in New York yesterday afternoon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TORONTO--The Canadian dollar was slightly lower against its U.S. counterpart late Tuesday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled his support for continuing the Fed's easy money policies.The U.S. dollar was at C$1.0263 late Tuesday, from C$1.0260 late Monday, according to data provider CQG.Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. dollar traded at a new seven-month high against the Canadian dollar, as Mr. Bernanke reiterated his commitment to the Fed's bond-buying program, arguing that the benefits of stimulus still outweigh the risks. But the greenback's gains proved short-lived.Such bond-buying programs, quantitative easing as they are known, are generally seen as corrosive to a currency, because they are viewed in the market as printing money.Mr. Bernanke, delivering day one of his two-day testimony on monetary policy to Congress, defended the Fed's open-ended bond-buying program, saying the associated risks don't outweigh the benefit of "promoting a stronger economic recovery and more-rapid job creation."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Watch what consumers do and not what they say.Despite steady drops in consumer confidence since the start of the year, consumers are borrowing again. Consumer installment credit has been rising at a fairly strong clip since December, in fact, its fastest growth rate since 1989.Yesterday, the Federal Reserve said the debt loads of Americans fell in May by $802 million, or at an annual rate of 1.3%, but the central bank blamed the drop on a statistical quirk. The Fed said the decline came about when $3 billion of loans were sold to groups outside the scope of its survey. If these loans had been counted in the survey, the report would have shown the tenth increase in a row.Auto loans in May rose a healthy $1.73 billion, or 7.9% at an annual rate, while credit-card debt and other revolving credit were up $942 million, or an annual rate of 4.3%."The overall dip is nothing to be concerned about," said Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "This doesn't indicate any real retrenchment."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve eased credit another notch Friday, continuing its effort to revive the economy.The move, which came shortly after the Labor Department announced a jump in the unemployment rate for February to 6.5%, will lower the interest rate on federal funds by a quarter of a point, to 6%. The federal funds rate is the rate on overnight loans between banks. It remains unclear what effect, if any, that move will have on mortgage rates or other bank lending rates.In the credit markets, short-term interest rates fell slightly after the Fed's action, but interest rates on long-term bonds rose.Chairman Alan Greenspan and other top Fed officials have said recently that the U.S.'s recession may be bottoming out, suggesting that the Fed's attempts to ease credit could end soon. However, Mr. Greenspan also has expressed concern that a "credit crunch" is still restricting bank lending and hurting the economy.In the financial markets, many traders seem to share the view that the economy is looking up and that the Fed's campaign to ease credit is all but over. "The markets appear to perceive this as the Fed's last easing move," said Robert Johnson, vice president, global markets, at Bankers Trust New York Corp.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NOT LONG AGO, investors would scoff at an investment that promised only a 3% return, even a guaranteed one. These days, plenty of investors would be happy to settle for that.And therein lies a problem for the insurance industry. With record-low interest rates and slumping stock prices, insurers say it's getting hard to provide the minimum guaranteed return on fixed annuities, which is set by law in many states at 3%. Every drop in interest rates, such as November's half-point cut by the Federal Reserve, makes fixed annuities even more attractive to customers -- sales were up 56% in the third quarter to $30 billion -- and more difficult for insurers to finance."What the latest rate cut shows is that the low interest-rate environment we were in a year ago continues, and is more and more problematic," says Bruce Ferguson, vice president of state relations for the American Council of Life Insurers, the insurance industry's trade group.To solve the problem at least temporarily, the insurance industry has an answer: Lower the 3% minimum guarantee on new policies to 1.5%.Sounds simple enough, but because fixed annuities are insurance products regulated by states, insurers can't just cut the return across the board. Rather, they must go from state to state seeking permission from regulators, and then try to get state legislatures to pass a new minimum. (Even then, any changes would apply only in the states that passed such a change.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>John Kerry, seizing the chance to define his candidacy before a national television audience with his presidential nomination acceptance speech, took the fight straight to the two areas where President Bush has enjoyed his greatest political strengths: national security and social values.Rather than shying away from ground that has sometimes been shaky for Democrats, Mr. Kerry planted his own flag in a forceful and at times combative speech. "Let there be no mistake: I will never hesitate to use force when it is required," the Massachusetts senator told 4,000 cheering delegates on the final night of the Democratic convention in Boston."Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response," he continued, attempting to meet widespread and persistent voter questions about whether a Democrat, even a war veteran, is tough enough to lead the country in fighting terrorism.At one point, Mr. Kerry appeared to belittle Mr. Bush's record as commander in chief, especially his justification for the war in Iraq. "Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities -- and I do -- because some issues just aren't all that simple," he said. "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so." It was one of several oblique shots Mr. Kerry took at the president and his advisers, even as he also called directly on President Bush to run a positive campaign.Confronting another of his party's vulnerabilities -- a perception that Democrats are out of the cultural mainstream -- Mr. Kerry's 45- minute speech tackled President Bush on social issues. "It's time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families," he said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Barack Obama is asking Americans to gamble that the U.S. economy can be taxed into prosperity. That's the message of his campaign for the Buffett Rule, which raises income-tax rates on millionaires to a minimum of 30%, and for the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. He wants to raise the highest income tax rate by 20%, double the rate on capital gains, add a new 3.8% tax on all capital earnings, and nearly triple the dividend tax rate.All this will enhance "economic efficiency," insists a White House economic report. As for those who disagree, says President Obama, they're just pushing "the same version of trickle-down economics tried for much of the last century. . . . But prosperity sure didn't trickle down."Mr. Obama needs a refresher course on the 1920s, 1960s, 1980s and even the 1990s, when government spending and taxes fell and employment and incomes grew rapidly.But if the president wants to see fresher evidence of how taxes matter, he can look to what's happening in the 50 states. In our new report "Rich States, Poor States," prepared for the American Legislative Exchange Council, we compare the economic performance of states with no income tax to that of states with high rates. It's like comparing Hong Kong with Greece or King Kong with fleas.Every year for the past 40, the states without income taxes had faster output growth (measured on a decadal basis) than the states with the highest income taxes. In 1980, for example, there were 10 zero-income-tax states. Over the decade leading up to 1980, those states grew 32.3 percentage points faster than the 10 states with the highest tax rates. Job growth was also much higher in the zero-tax states. The states with the nine highest income tax rates had no net job growth at all, and seven of those nine managed to lose jobs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It isn't the forecast but the weather that tells you when to open the umbrella.Janet Yellen opened the Kansas City Federal Reserve annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Friday with the observation that conditions in labor markets have outperformed Fed forecasts--and that if this continues the Fed funds target rate could rise earlier and more rapidly than expected.That is a subtle change of emphasis from the Fed chairwoman. Consider a speech she gave at the Economic Club of New York in April. The background message was the same--monetary policy isn't on a preset course and will change based on economic conditions. But the policy implications of this centered around the possibility of a labor "shortfall" necessitating a continuation of ultralow interest rates.Now Ms. Yellen is also talking about the possibility of raising rates sooner and at a brisker pace in the case of a "faster convergence" toward the Fed's labor market and inflation goals.Additionally, Ms. Yellen noted that the labor market may not have as much slack as stagnant wages might seem to indicate. The inability of some employers to push down wages during the economic slump may have resulted in "pent-up wage deflation" that could hold worker pay down even as the labor market tightens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit increase in May raised concerns about the strength of the nation's export market.The trade gap grew to $7.38 billion from April's revised deficit of $7.06 billion, the Commerce Department said. It was the third month in a row that the trade gap has widened, and placed it at its largest level in a year and a half.The May deficit is troublesome because of a substantial drop in exports, which have been largely credited with helping to lead the nation back to economic health. But as other nations struggle with their own economic problems, their demand for U.S. goods slackens.Exports totaled $35.49 billion in May, down 2.5% from April. The drop reflected decreases in overseas sales of foods, capital goods and automotive vehicles, parts and engines.The drop in capital goods reflected a large decline in sales of civilian aircraft, which fell more than 28%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BEIJING -- Economists and politicians from Brussels to Washington say that the Chinese yuan is undervalued. For China's own good and that of the global economy, they say, the currency needs to move up in a big way, and soon.So why hasn't China revalued? Part of the answer is Japan.The last time the U.S. was faced with a rising Asian export power, the currency also became a big political issue. And in September 1985 the major economies of the time met at the Plaza Hotel in New York to ease those tensions. The accord they reached caused the dollar to fall from roughly 240 Japanese yen to about 160 over two years.Today, China's critics are demanding a similarly sweeping move. But Japan soon regretted agreeing to a big surge in the yen: Growth slowed abruptly, which pushed the government to boost spending and lower interest rates. A real-estate bubble and a years-long slump followed. And the issue the Plaza Accord was intended to fix -- Japan's sizable trade surplus -- remains to this day.From Japan's example, Chinese thinkers learned that a big exchange-rate move could damage their economy, and won't necessarily help the trade balance.</TEXT>

In February, after workers at Caterpillar's locomotive plant in London, Ontario, refused a pay cut, the company closed the factory and eliminated their jobs. In the 1990s, Caterpillar used white-collar staff and temporary workers to operate plants during strikes by the United Auto Workers, who eventually capitulated.Now, even though more than 500 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAM, will enter the second week of a strike Tuesday, Caterpillar insists it will maintain production at the Joliet plant, which makes hydraulic parts.The strikers are protesting Caterpillar's six-year contract proposal that could freeze pay for many workers, reduce benefits and change work schedules.Many workers across the nation, including union members and civil servants, have been swallowing hard and accepting reduced benefits, flat or declining wages and higher health-care costs as companies and state and local governments search for savings. States with lower wages and restrictions on unions are attracting new plants. Union power is declining.</TEXT>

Mr. Sullivan said the two-year note's rally last week -- which took the yield down to levels not seen since 2004 -- had more to do with risk aversion than with economic fundamentals.He has shifted out of shorter-dated notes into the five- and 10-year sectors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Author: Brian BlackstonePolicy makers at the European Central Bank face the same high unemployment and slow growth that dogs their friends across the Atlantic at the Federal Reserve. But don't expect the ECB to follow the Fed in taking extraordinary measures to try to get things moving again.The Fed thinks it can and should use the tools at its disposal, in this case buying U.S. Treasury bonds to bring down long-term interest rates and goose growth, because doing so will bring down the jobless rate.The Europeans won't have any of it. They view their unemployment problem as more structural, the result of rigid labor rules that discourage hiring of workers who won't move to the places where jobs exist or shortages of workers with skills employers demand.To the Fed, by contrast, the problem at least in the U.S. is seen as more likely a collapse in demand. If that is true and if the Fed can reignite growth, it will mean a quick drop in unemployment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Texas' unemployment rate is hovering around 4%, so the state's fund for unemployment benefits ought to be flush with cash, right? Think again.In the past year, the unemployment trust fund has seen a dramatic rise in the size of monthly benefit payments. Total payments in the first quarter of 1999 jumped 42% to about $312 million from $219 million in the same period last year.At the same time, the monthly balance of the fund has decreased. As of last week, officials project the fund at the end of May will have a balance of about $847 million, 13% below the May 1998 balance.Oddly, the trend is partly due to the state's healthy economy, which is in some ways aggravating the effect of Oil Patch and other layoffs that account for the shrinking fund balances. If current trends continue, the fund by this fall could drop so far that there will be little or no new money to transfer to the state's worker-training programs. It also could reach the level that would trigger an automatic increase in the unemployment insurance premiums paid by employers.This outlook is, of course, subject to change; an unexpected drop in the number of people collecting jobless benefits would enable the fund to build back up. But the trend is unmistakable. In their latest projection, officials with the Texas Workforce Commission say the trust fund will have a balance of $651 million on Oct. 1, excluding money tentatively set aside for job training; as recently as March, officials projected a balance of $756 million.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Interest rates continued to tumble yesterday amid fresh evidence that the economy is losing steam.The average yield at the Treasury's $4 billion sale of new 20-year, one-month bonds yesterday dropped to 11.69%, the lowest since a similar auction in June 1983. That was down from an average return of 13.76% at the previous sale of similar bonds on July 5.Another reduction in the banking industry's prime lending rate appears likely soon, analysts say. Yesterday, First Bank Minneapolis trimmed its base rate on corporate loans to 12 1/4% from 12 1/2%. A smaller bank, National City Bank of Minneapolis, went a step further, cutting its rate to 12%. Most major banks currently are quoting a 12 1/2% rate."We're going to have a 12% prime rate before the month is over and further declines in November to 11 1/2%," predicted Joseph Bench, a vice president and economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc. He said the Federal Reserve System has eased credit conditions in an attempt to bolster the economy."The Fed is troubled by the abrupt downshift in economic growth, and it doesn't want it to snowball into a recession," he added.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Investors were happy that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday, but sad that the cut wasn't bigger, so they bid stocks through a series of gyrations that finally left them little changed.In heavy trading at the time of the Fed announcement at about 2:15 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 100 points in eight minutes. Then it climbed to its high for the day, only to fall again. The average closed down 28.32, or 0.35%, at 8080.52. On the New York Stock Exchange, however, advancers and decliners were about even.Treasury bonds gained, since interest rates on new bonds will be lower than on existing bonds, and the dollar fell.Stocks already had gained in broad anticipation of a cut of at least one-quarter point in the federal-funds rate, the rate at which banks lend one another money overnight. Traders had been hoping for a larger, half-point cut. Few were surprised when stocks fell on news of the smaller rate cut, and some said the quick recovery could herald continuing strength."I think it kind of bodes well," said Bill Schneider, head of block trading at Warburg Dillon Read, who noted that some investors have been holding money out of the market. "I think a lot of cash has been raised," he said, partly as "window dressing" for quarterly fund-management reports, to show that mutual-fund managers are being conservative.</TEXT>

Yesterday, the 30-year bellwether Treasury rose 18/32, or $5.625 per $1,000 bond, to yield 5.87%, the lowest level since October 1993. The rally was fueled in part by the latest slump in Asian stock markets. (Rates move in the opposite direction to bond prices.)</TEXT>

Mr. Martin said he initiated the deal, partly because ONI's telecommunications-carrier customers had expressed "some concern about breadth of product line" and customer support from ONI as a stand-alone company.Although Ciena has increased its market share over the past year, the Linthicum, Md., company -- like its competitors -- has been hit hard by plummeting demand for networking gear, as telecommunications carriers rein in spending or struggle to stay in business. Ciena recently warned of sharply falling revenue and a substantial loss for its fiscal first quarter, ended Jan. 31.Ciena's top competitors include Nortel Networks Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc., Alcatel SA and others.Demand for metropolitan network equipment, however, "is holding up much better than the long-haul" network segment, said Gary Smith, Ciena's president and chief executive. The combination of the companies' product lines stands to be "compelling from a customer point of view," he said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HONG KONG -- With bad checks flying in the wake of Hong Kong's stock market collapse, a group of brokers held an emergency meeting Tuesday with government and stock exchange officials.Sources say that at the meeting, which took place in Monetary Affairs Secretary David Nendick's office, the government official asked if the exchange had complied with his request to identify brokers who had issued bad checks. To his surprise, Jeffrey Sun, the exchange's chief executive, said the action hadn't been taken.As Mr. Sun started to explain, Mr. Nendick interrupted him and said: "I think I'm hearing something I don't want to hear."The exchange's inaction -- and Mr. Nendick's exasperation -- sum up the crisis of confidence gripping Hong Kong's stock market. That crisis erupted Oct. 19 when local prices fell in line with the global market plunge. The other markets took a beating and kept on trading. But in Hong Kong, the collapse has set off an escalating controversy over the stock exchange's powerful -- but seemingly arbitrary -- management committee and the government's lame attempts so far to rein it in.The debate began with the market's four-day closing last week, ordered in part, the committee said, to calm the public. That backfired Monday when the market reopened to suffer its worst one-day plunge. Nor has investor confidence been helped by revelations Tuesday that a brokerage controlled by Ronald Li, chairman of the committee and stock exchange, faces problems from trading in Hong Kong's shaky futures market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MOST EVERYONE on Wall Street predicted the dollar's three-year bear market would get even worse this year. And, despite its impressive rally in recent months, most are again calling for dollar declines in 2006.With the U.S. currency climbing to a fresh two-year high against the euro Friday and hovering around a 26-month best against the yen, there are nascent signs the bearish consensus may be splintering. A few analysts are even arguing that the dollar could strengthen further next year.That could have implications for stock investors. Too strong a currency can hurt exporters by making their goods less globally competitive, weighing on earnings. Some fund managers say a stronger dollar could increase stock prices by helping squelch inflationary pressures. That would keep interests rates from rising too quickly and abruptly slowing the economy."We're looking for a continuation of the dollar rally," says Gary Thayer, chief economist for A.G. Edwards and one of the rare dollar bulls at the end of last year. "And we think we're close to a point where others may also start to begin thinking more favorably about the dollar."That day may be closer than he suspects. A Dow Jones Newswires survey of 18 banks last week showed a median forecast for a dollar decline of about 9% against the euro and the yen by the end of next year. These dollar forecasts are rosier than ones made three weeks ago, reflecting a broad, if modest, shift in thinking that the dollar can at least hold its gains longer than expected.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TORONTO -- Canadian Auto Workers President Robert White opened contract talks with the Canadian subsidiary of General Motors Corp. by demanding higher wages and improved protection against inflation.The union leader also demanded some guarantees against possible job losses that result from corporate strategic decisions. However, the CAW is more accepting of job losses resulting from a downturn in market conditions, contrary to the United Auto Workers, which is seeking total job security during contract negotiations in the U.S.Frederick Curd, GM Canada's vice president and director of personnel, said any wage increase must be tied to improvements in productivity. He said the company was looking for a "moderate settlement" that would help protect GM's market share in Canada. In the first nine months of the 1990 model year, which began last October, GM had 33.9% of the Canadian car market, down from 34.9% in all of 1989.Both sides said they hadn't defined how big a wage increase they would consider. Both the Canadian and U.S. union contracts with the Big Three automakers, including GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., expire Sept. 14.Mr. Curd said GM Canada also wants more flexible work rules at its plants and improved attendance levels. He said absenteeism, including sick leave and scheduled vacations, currently runs at an average 18.2% of GM's Canadian work force, compared with about 15% at the company's U.S. plants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FRANKFURT--Allianz SE said it will increase its dividend-payout ratio for this year so that shareholders aren't penalized for an expected decline in net profit that the insurer said doesn't adequately reflect its performance.Chief Financial Officer Oliver B_te told reporters and analysts the ratio will be higher than the usual 40% of net profit, as the company's operating earnings are stable, even though the company now expects 2011 net profit to be "well below" last year's figure of [euro]5.05 billion ($6.87 billion).Mr. B_te said net profit is vulnerable to negative non-operating losses from volatile markets. He declined to be more specific. Allianz paid a dividend of [euro]4.50 a share for 2010.The company, Europe's largest primary insurer by market capitalization, said it nonetheless remains on track to reach its targeted full-year operating profit of between [euro]7.5 billion and [euro]8.5 billion. The company considers operating profit to a more effective measure of its performance than net profit, and third-quarter operating profit fell less than analysts had expected.Allianz shares climbed 5.6%, or [euro]4.05, to [euro]76.25, as investors focused on that part of its earnings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Corrections & AmplificationsA TABLE accompanying an article on Friday's Home Front page incorrectly referred to the time frame for data on home appreciation. The correct time frame is the period from the first quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1997. In that period, home values in Modesto, Calif., rose 1.8%, while home values rose 2.2% in Stockton, Calif., and 2.5% in Vallejo, Calif. The table incorrectly stated that home values in those areas fell last year. (WSJ March 9, 1998)This may seem like a flashback, but it isn't. Burt Reynolds is a movie star again. Your friends are wearing Lacoste. And your home is showing significant appreciation.Home values rose 4.9% in 1997, well above the nation's average inflation rate of 1.7%, according to an index that tracks repeat home sales compiled by mortgage buyers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. That means U.S. home prices have climbed faster than inflation for three straight years. The country hasn't seen such good news on the housing front since the late 1980s.Perhaps the biggest surprise in the index was the gain posted by Flint, Mich., a gritty factory town of about 430,000 whose economic woes were chronicled in the quirky 1989 documentary "Roger & Me." With auto makers hiring again, Flint's housing prices jumped 25% last year. The median home price in Flint was $102,845, up 64% from 1990.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The unconventional measures introduced by many central banks in response to financial turmoil could create other problems if carried out for too long, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements said Sunday.Central banks currently find themselves "caught in the middle," Jaime Caruana said, "forced to be the policy makers of last resort."They are providing monetary stimulus on a "massive scale," supplying liquidity to banks unable to fund themselves in markets and easing government financing burdens by keeping interest rates low, said Mr. Caruana, speaking in Basel, Switzerland, at the annual general meeting of the BIS, a consortium of the world's central banks."These emergency measures could have undesirable side effects if continued for too long," he said. "A worry is that monetary policy would be pressured to do still more because not enough action has been taken in other areas."Mr. Caruana's comments come as central bankers from Beijing to Frankfurt to Washington come under renewed pressure to step up efforts to resuscitate the slowing global economy. Some economists and politicians--and some central bankers in the U.S. and the U.K.--argue that central banks are too hesitant, condemning their economies to slower growth and higher unemployment than necessary in the wake of the financial crisis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Corrections & AmplificationsFamilies in Michigan can receive welfare benefits for a maximum of four years. A U.S. news article Friday incorrectly said the maximum was two years.(WSJ June 29, 2009)Michigan's generous jobless benefits and strict eligibility rules have kept the welfare rolls down despite the state's 14.1% unemployment rate, the highest in the country. But a surge in jobless workers reaching the time limit for unemployment benefits in coming months could change that.A major test for the state's welfare system could come by January, when nearly one in seven unemployed workers will have exhausted their jobless benefits, unless the laws change, said Norm Isotalo, a spokesman for Michigan's unemployment-insurance agency. Many of the more than 680,000 unemployed workers in the state are collecting jobless benefits, which last for as long as 79 weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Federal Reserve's Sept. 18 decision to stay the course on its asset purchases surprised and confused many market participants, who felt the central bank had sent contradictory signals about its intentions. In fact, the Fed has behaved in a way completely consistent with Chairman Ben Bernanke's public comments, at least since July. A careful look at the labor market numbers suggests that if the Fed sticks to the chairman's words, there will be no significant tapering any time soon.Before July, the Fed announced on a number of occasions that a 6.5% unemployment rate would indicate that it is time to start raising interest rates and winding down its easy-money policies. The unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its high of 10% in October 2009 to the mid-sevens. But the labor market is still sickly because, as I pointed out in these pages in June, the employment rate--the proportion of the working-age population that has jobs--has made little progress.The employment rate is the best single indicator of labor-market health, and it is still hovering at around 58.5%, down significantly from its pre-recession levels of over 63%. The economy is adding jobs, but just barely staying ahead of population growth. Rather than making up for ground lost during the recession, the economy is still treading water.Mr. Bernanke and other Fed governors are clearly aware of the distinction between the unemployment and employment rates. In his July 17 congressional testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that "if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment (my emphasis), the [Federal Open Market] Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6.5% as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate." The jobs report for August showed the decline in labor-force participation and employment rates that the Fed feared.On Sept. 18--following the FOMC's vote to continue its current pace of bond-buying--Mr. Bernanke reinforced the message. "The unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure in all circumstances of the state of the labor market overall," he said. "We are looking for overall improvement in the labor market."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The year 2003 was fabulous for Europe's fledgling currency, the euro. Against the dollar, the euro advanced some 19% from the first to the last day of the year. And as 2004's trading year starts in earnest, it looks like more of the same.One would think European Central Bank officials would be dancing in the streets because of the euro's obvious success. But on the contrary -- there is much nervous fretting and fussing in Frankfurt that the currency is too high, that its ascent has been too fast, that something might have to be done about the strong currency, and other such nonsense. In today's Europe, it seems, nothing fails like success.There are, in fact, two reasons why the euro is appreciating. The first is the combination of relatively strong U.S. economic growth and Alan Greenspan's refusal to raise interest rates. The stronger the U.S. economy, the bigger the external deficit -- and the greater the need for higher interest rates to attract sufficient capital inflow into the U.S. to finance the deficit. Without the rate hike, the dollar goes down because the capital inflow will not be sufficient to finance the trade imbalance.The Europeans long have stressed the need for dollar devaluation to correct the U.S. current account imbalance. Now that the correction has come, many are having second thoughts.The second reason for the euro's strength is the credibility of the ECB's monetary policy. Because the ECB's Governing Council has been doing such an outstanding job of pursuing a price-stability-based monetary policy, central banks throughout the world -- but especially in Asia -- are converting dollars into euros.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Workers across the country are seeing the length of their jobless benefits pared back, a shakeout that is playing out unevenly and pinching people in states still struggling with unemployment above the national average.The changes in benefits are partly the result of an improving job market but are also due to budget pressures at the state and federal level.In Michigan, one of the states hardest-hit by the economic downturn and where unemployment remains close to 9%, job seekers will soon receive less than a year of benefits for the first time since the recession hit in 2007.Michigan, which like many states offered 99 weeks of state and federally funded benefits at the peak of its jobs crisis, will become the 19th state to offer less than a year of payments to new claimants for jobless benefits. Nine other states offer more than a year but less than 60 weeks. More changes are coming: North Carolina recently passed a law that will cut benefits to 20 weeks starting in July.John Rowloff, a single father of two teenagers in Monroe, Mich., got the last of his unemployment checks earlier this year but says he has seen little improvement in the local labor market even as the state's official jobless rate has fallen to 8.9% from as high as 14.2% in 2009.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>THIS WEEK, no less an authority than Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that many Americans may have the wrong mortgage.In a speech to credit unions, Mr. Greenspan said that Federal Reserve Board research showed that "many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable-rate mortgages rather than fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade" as rates tumbled.Yet the more expensive fixed-rate loans accounted for 81% of mortgage originations last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. That's because most borrowers are risk-averse and fixed- rate mortgages protect them from the possibility that interest rates will rise over the life of the loan.The problem is that as home prices soar, choosing a long-term loan is an increasingly costly decision. In the current market, borrowers can cut the rate on their mortgage drastically by opting for an adjustable-rate mortgage instead of a 30-year fixed-rate loan. Currently, rates average 5.71% on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages while they average just 4.53% on mortgages that carry the same rate for the first five years and then adjust yearly, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.Lenders are increasingly pushing ARMs because they allow buyers to either trim their payments or buy more home for the same payment. At Washington Mutual Inc., ARMs accounted for 55% of home loan applications in the fourth quarter. At a time of rising home prices, the lower start rates on ARMs allow borrowers "to maximize their buying power," says Greg Sayegh, Washington Mutual senior vice president.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Under the glare of a Justice Department antitrust investigation, Nasdaq Stock Market traders have been quietly tightening up their pricing -- at least for big, high-profile Nasdaq stocks.Price "spreads" on many such stocks have narrowed, or certainly are more negotiable, since the Justice Department's inquiry into alleged price fixing was disclosed last month, say traders at several Wall Street securities firms that are part of the Nasdaq system. Spreads -- the difference between the "ask" price at which dealers will sell a stock and the "bid" price at which they will buy stock -- indicate how much brokers stand to profit from trading a given stock.According to the traders, Microsoft Corp.'s trading spread currently is consistently 1/8 of a point, or 12.5 cents, whereas it used to trade often at 1/4 point, or 25 cents. Intel Corp. has also been tightened up to trade consistently with a 12.5-cent spread, as have Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. Microsoft, Intel and Oracle are Nasdaq's biggest stocks, and Cisco is the sixth-biggest. Any spread above 12.5 cents tends to raise eyebrows given that on the New York Stock Exchange, big issues typically trade at 1/8-point spreads.But spreads haven't changed much -- actually, they've widened in individual cases -- on some of the least-active stocks among Nasdaq's 5,700 issues, traders say. Spreads are typically wider on smaller stocks, even those listed on markets other than Nasdaq, because they tend to be riskier for dealers to hold in inventory and more difficult to trade than big stocks.Nasdaq's pricing practices have become a hot topic since an academic study in May suggested that Nasdaq dealers "implicitly collude" to maintain wide spreads of 25 cents or more on the 100 most-active Nasdaq stocks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Board has imposed further tough restrictions on the operations of limited-service banks, a move that some bankers say will make these new banks unattractive to set up.The restrictions, which are set out in a letter to Suburban Bancorp, Bethesda, Md., go beyond those publicly announced by the Fed, some bankers say. They prohibit a bank holding company from providing most banking services, such as check clearing, data processing and check cashing, for a limited-service banking office.The new limitations also put the Fed increasingly at odds with the Comptroller of the Currency, which already has approved applications for dozens of limited service banks.Limited-service banks, because they either don't make commercial loans or don't take demand deposits, fall outside the legal definition of a bank. Creation of large numbers of limited-service banks around the country would transform the banking industry, since they provide a way around the prohibition on interstate banking and bank ownership by non-banking businesses.The latest restrictions strike most noticeably at bank holding companies, which are eager to set up limited-service banking operations beyond their home states. But Fed officials have made it clear that their real goal is to keep non-banking giants, such as Merrill Lynch & Co. and Sears, Roebuck & Co., out of the banking business.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>U.S. regulators are warning banks to stop lending excessive sums to fund corporate takeovers.A year after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued guidelines designed to deter banks from funding deals that regulators feel are too laden with debt, some banks have continued to finance such deals under the impression that the guidelines are flexible.But now, the OCC says it isn't giving banks any wiggle room on the guidelines, which limit the amount they can lend to fund corporate buyouts and attempt to stamp out other lending practices regulators consider risky."On new issuance, we have a 'no exceptions' policy," Martin Pfinsgraff, the OCC's senior deputy comptroller for large-bank supervision, said in an interview.Starting late last summer, the Federal Reserve and OCC sent letters to banks demanding they comply with guidance published in March 2013 saying they should avoid financing takeover deals that would put debt on a company of more than six times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. The guidelines also are designed to limit borrowing agreements that don't contain lender protections known as covenants and stretch out payment timelines.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- A House tax panel intends to consider a bill to expand various taxpayer rights, including a measure aimed at curbing predatory "tax refund anticipation" loans.The House Ways and Means Committee is to consider today the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007. A description of the draft bill offers eight taxpayer-rights provisions, all of which have either no or negligible revenue effects, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.The item aimed at refund anticipation loans would prohibit the Treasury secretary from providing a "debt indicator" to tax preparers involved in preparing such loans with high fees or interest rates. Refund anticipation loans are short-term loans keyed to a person's pending tax refund. Consumers groups say many refund anticipation loans carry excessive interest rates.A debt indicator helps in the granting of refund anticipation loans because it tells whether a taxpayer has any offsetting debts to the federal government that could first be claims against a tax refund, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The debt indicator therefore reduces a lender's risk because it shows whether the government will seek to intercept part of the tax refund.The bill would prohibit the Treasury secretary from providing a debt indicator to any person involved in making refund anticipation loans with "predatory" charges and fees.</TEXT>

That concern triggered brisk activity on the commodity exchanges, and now many commodity prices, after sluggish activity stemming from a 6 1/2-year bear market, appear to have bottomed out.Many investors "are convinced commodity prices have begun to move," John Urbanchuk, an economist for Wharton Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., says.

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- Just a few months ago, American policy makers fretted that the world economy was flying on a single engine, the turbo-charged U.S. Now, they see signs that Europe and Japan and other parts of Asia may finally be revving up again.The brighter prospects for global growth are moving financial markets. The dollar has fallen against the yen as well as the euro, as investors shift their capital to increasingly attractive investment opportunities outside the U.S. Yesterday, the dollar dropped to its lowest level against the yen in seven months, in part because of a fresh batch of positive economic news out of Tokyo.President Clinton said in a recent television interview that he wasn't "particularly alarmed" by the dollar's modest decline. He said that his administration still supports a strong dollar. But he also suggested that the currency's recent softness is a price worth paying for the benefits of more-balanced world growth.A stronger global economy provides "a stronger market for our exports, and reduces pressures on other countries to dump surplus products into our markets," says Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. More broadly, Mr. Summers says that recovery abroad means "a more stable and harmonious global economy, in which disruptive shocks to financial systems are less likely."Yet just as foreign turmoil produced both winners and losers in the U.S. during the past two years, a rebound overseas would cause a new round of gain and pain at home.</TEXT>

AIG later had to amend its regulatory filings several times and provide the information after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested more disclosure."This letter raises more questions on the inner-workings of the New York Fed during one of the most pivotal periods in our nation's history," Mr. Issa said.Credit: By Michael R.

    <TEXT>U.S. Treasury bonds pulled back after an early price gain, underscoring some uneasiness among traders and investors ahead of the Federal Reserve's next decision on its monetary stimulus for the economy.The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to start a two-day monetary policy meeting Tuesday with an interest-rate statement due at about 2 p.m. EST Wednesday.Market participants will zero in on whether the Fed will announce plans to dial back, or "taper," its bond purchases. The central bank's $85 billion-a-month purchases in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities have been a major factor holding Treasury yields near historic lows.Traders, investors and analysts believe an improving economy would allow the Fed to start winding down its monetary stimulus. The Fed could act this week or wait until early January to cut bond buying, they said, though they believe the central bank would wind down its monetary stimulus on a gradual basis, which is likely to prevent a sharp rise in bond yields."We do think the odds of a December taper have gone up," said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc. "That said, the more likely time frame is early 2014, a view supported by the fact that inflation continues to remain low, allowing the Fed more latitude."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BLUE CHIPS extended their slump into a second day, as investors bit their nails ahead of today's release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve interest-rate meeting.Investors are nervous because the Fed changed the wording of its post-meeting statement last month, suggesting growing concerns about inflation. People fear the minutes will indicate building pressure among Fed policy makers to raise interest rates more sharply. Many people simply are avoiding stocks, and volume -- 1.22 billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange and 1.33 billion on the Nasdaq Stock Market -- was the year's lightest at both markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.78 points, or 0.12%, to 10448.56, down 3.1% so far this year. More stocks fell than rose on the Big Board. But gains in drug and financial stocks helped the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inch up 0.01 point -- less than 0.001% -- to 1181.21, off 2.5% this year."What I think has really been hurting the market is the Fed. They are talking about raising interest rates more," to control inflation, said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at New York brokerage firm SG Cowen. "Now we will see what the Fed was thinking, if they are really seeing inflation."Investors also await quarterly profit announcements, with General Electric and Citigroup reporting Friday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>CHICAGO -- Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, called for the Fed to do more to charge up the economy, including a new program of U.S. Treasury bond purchases and possibly a declaration that it wants inflation to rise for a time beyond its informal 2% target."In the last several months I've stared at our unemployment forecast and come to the conclusion that it's just not coming down nearly as quickly as it should," Mr. Evans said Monday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. "This is a far grimmer forecast than we ought to have," he added. As result, he said, he favors "much more [monetary] accommodation than we've put in place."The comments are significant because Mr. Evans tends to reflect the broad center of gravity at the central bank. His prescription for aggressive action, though not uniformly held by his colleagues, suggests a shift in the mood at the Fed.On the heels of remarks by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley, it is likely to reinforce a growing conviction among investors that the Fed will restart a bond-buying program when it meets Nov. 2 and 3.It also suggests Fed deliberations are going beyond resuming bond-buying plans to contemplating new strategies for inflation and for communicating the Fed's stance to the public.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The unemployed don't spend much.They do, however, brush their teeth and power their homes and seek medical care. And the companies that sell such products or services could remain attractive investments as the economy heads into what many see as a jobless recovery.The U.S.'s unemployment rate recently hit 9.5%, its highest level since the early 1980s. Many economists see it going above 10% and only slowly receding. They say an economic recovery won't inspire much hiring as companies grapple with slower economic growth, overcapacity in numerous sectors, and slack demand driven in part by a newfound saving ethic among overleveraged consumers.Double-digit unemployment, says Peter Gutmann, economics professor at Baruch College of the City University of New York, "could be with us for some time."A jobless recovery might not decimate the stock market overall since high unemployment limits wage pressures and keeps interest rates low. Low rates "are helpful for the P/E [price/earnings] multiples on stocks" because investors perceive better upside in equities than in safe, low-return Treasury bonds, says Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at Bank of New York Mellon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So is it over? Have governments in the U.S. and Europe finally found the cure? Has recession been averted?No. We're still in for a rough recession, with U.S. unemployment, now at 6.1%, likely to rise above 8%, with all the misery that brings.But it could be worse. For a few scary moments last week, governments began to take action to protect their own countries that made other countries worse off. It looked like the world economy was lurching uncomfortably close to conditions that precipitated the Great Depression. The newfound trans-Atlantic unity -- particularly the move by the U.K., then the rest of Europe and now the U.S., to give the banking system a taxpayer-funded transfusion -- has significantly reduced the odds of a really bad outcome. That alone is reason to be less panicky today than many were this time last week.Paul Krugman, the newest Nobel laureate in economics, described in a CNBC interview Tuesday the latest government action as "emergency battlefield medicine to keep the guy from bleeding to death." That's no small accomplishment given how bad the wounds were. If the treatments work as intended, banks should resume lending at least to each other, a necessary step toward recovery.The new U.S. plan "is going to boost confidence that the most extreme downside risks have been diminished, but the damage has been done, and this isn't going to prevent the economy from being in recession and remaining weak for a while," Laurence Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Federal Reserve governor, said Tuesday.

    <TEXT>TOKYO -- Japanese stocks pulled back yesterday, as uncertainty over the downfall of corporate financier Yoshiaki Murakami and declines in U.S. stocks from Friday prompted profit-taking in pricey blue-chip shares such as Toyota Motor, Canon and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial.But many of the stocks in Mr. Murakami's fund rose, after falling sharply on Friday on fears the fund might sell off its shares.The Nikkei Stock Average dropped 121 points, or 0.8%, to 15668.31 following a 285.57-point rally on Friday.Most investors said the effect likely would be limited on the overall Tokyo stock market from the Murakami scandal. But some also said they want to see foreign investors' reactions to the news. Mr. Murakami, who leads the so-called Murakami Fund, admitted yesterday that he had violated the country's insider-trading laws, and would step away from his own fund and investments.Yesterday, the home for many of the Murakami stocks of start-up companies, the TSE Mothers market, saw its index rise 3.4% to 1393.86, but it is still down about 50% from its year high of 2799.06 in January. Among the stocks in which the Murakami fund holds a major stake, Matsuzakaya, Sumitomo Warehouse, GMO Internet and New Japan Radio all rose.</TEXT>

Not even low-risk sectors such as utilities or consumer staples were spared. Then in Asia yesterday, the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 4.4%, leaving it down 16% this month. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which includes a number of China plays, lost an additional 2.3%, bringing its loss for November to 17%.The U.S. stock selloff on Wednesday included a 211.10-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the third straight drop. At 12799.04, the Dow is now up 2.7% on the year. It also is nearly 10% off its October highs -- the textbook definition of a "correction" that shakes speculative excess out of the market."It's no longer a need for return," said Treasury-bond strategist John Spinello at Jefferies & Co. "It's preserving your capital."Stocks have often bounced after such corrections in the past. For now at least, investors seem to be heading somewhere else instead. The price of a benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained about $2.50 for each $1,000 invested Wednesday. That pushed its yield to 4.024%, its lowest level since September 2005.

Equity funds suffered some of their steepest outflows during the summer, when investors retreated from a volatile stock market due to concerns about an uncertain economic outlook and U.S. and European debt.For the week ended Jan. 18, equity funds had net outflows of $484 million, compared with prior-week inflows of $1.42 billion. Investors pulled $804 million from U.S. equities and added $320 million to foreign funds.Meanwhile, the ICI reported bond funds had inflows of $5.56 billion, compared with prior-week inflows of $7.87 billion. Investors added $3.81 billion to taxable funds, while inflows to municipal funds totaled $1.74 billion. Investors also poured $1.27 billion into hybrid funds after prior-week inflows of $1.95 billion. Such funds can invest in both stocks and fixed-income assets.Separately, assets in money-market funds fell $2.54 billion in the latest week as investors pulled money from taxable government funds and tax-free funds, according to iMoneyNet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A chorus of inflation-related worries pushed down stocks, bonds and the dollar, knocking back the Dow Jones Industrial Average from Monday's record.Traders said the declines didn't focus on one particular area. The industrial average lost 45.09, or 0.49%, to close at 9147.57, nearly canceling out all of Monday's 45.59-point gain. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 13.95 to 1864.91 and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.57 to 1115.50.The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32, or $7.18 per $1,000 bond, to push up its yield to 5.98%, again approaching the closely watched 6% level.Traders blamed the broad-based declines on worries that the Federal Reserve might be preparing to raise interest rates at its next monetary-policy meeting May 19. Volume was relatively light as many investors chose to stay out of the market.Inflation worries focused first on April's employment numbers, due to be announced Friday. If those indicate strong gains, some people fear, it could push the Fed to act. Then word spread that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was scheduled to meet President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin yesterday afternoon. The White House said the meeting was on the economy, not interest rates, but speculation spread that they might be laying the groundwork for a rate boost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dow Jones NewswiresWASHINGTON -- A barrage of sunny economic data poured in Wednesday, led by an upbeat regional report from the Federal Reserve's latest anecdotal survey of the economy.The Federal Reserve's survey of business activity found that economic conditions were improving across the country and appear to be "reasonably broadly based," with most areas noting growth in a number of industries.Eleven of the 12 regional Fed districts reported faster growth, except the Atlanta district, which said the pace of economic growth was "stable" in October and early November. "Labor markets across the nation generally improved or remained stable, with several districts noting a slowing in layoffs," the Fed said. Temporary workers are in increasing demand in the Boston, Minneapolis, Chicago and Richmond, Va., districts, the Fed said. But several districts reported that companies are waiting for sustained increases in orders before hiring permanent workers.Also Wednesday, there were two upbeat reports on the U.S. manufacturing sector, which was the hardest-hit part of the economy during the 2001 recession. Orders for big-ticket items surged in October and a regional manufacturing index soared to a nine-year high in November. "The factory sector is on fire," said Stephen Stanley, senior market economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TOKYO -- The decline in Japan's population could undermine the country's economic recovery unless workers perform more productively, and the new economy minister is taking aim at inefficient industries and workers.Hiroko Ota, who took office in September, faces an economy that is back on track after more than a decade in a slump. Japan's big structural problems have mostly been fixed: The banks have cleaned up their bad loans, and prices have stopped falling. Japan's economy grew at an average of more than 2% a year from 2003 through 2005, and it is expected to grow another 2% or so a year in 2006 and 2007.But long-term challenges remain. Japan's huge national debt amounts to 175% of gross domestic product, compared with 64% in the U.S. Cutting the debt gets harder with a falling population because Japan has fewer tax-paying workers. If production per worker increases more slowly than the number of workers falls, overall economic production will fall."Japan has escaped from its downturn," the 52-year-old Ms. Ota said in an interview. "We need to improve productivity more than the population declines."Japan, like mature economies in Europe, is engaged in a major rethinking of its economy -- including how to pare down welfare states along with the job and market protections introduced during the years after World War II. These changes now are seen as barriers to growth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in January, the Commerce Department said, as exports continued to slip but imports fell faster.The January deficit was $5.77 billion, compared with a revised December figure of $6 billion, the department reported. Exports fell in January to $35.54 billion from a revised $35.89 billion in December, while imports dropped to $41.3 billion from a revised $41.89 billion.Although exports declined slightly, they continue to be a source of frustration for U.S. manufacturers. Exports were one of the few bright spots in the economy last year, jumping 7.6% to a record level.But now, economic growth overseas has stalled just as the domestic economy is beginning to pick up. In December, exports fell a revised 2.9%, their third decline in a row. December imports rose a revised 1.9%.The slowdown in exports is consistent with the economic slowdown in Germany and Japan and continued weakness in Canada, said John Silvia, chief economist for Kemper Securities in Chicago. "It's not just one sector that's being hit, it's both manufacturing and agriculture. It's a tough phase in the cycle, and this is typically what happens."</TEXT>

The dollar likely will weaken against the yen, falling from the current 108-yen level to around 107 yen.A whirlwind of disappointing U.S. economic data and record-breaking oil and gold prices has damped hopes for the dollar's resurgence. An early-year rally had been widely expected by many currency analysts."The expected dollar rally is still a way off," said Jim McCormick, head of currency research at Lehman Brothers in London. He pointed to the continued surge in commodity prices, slow growth, and inflation. Investors seeking havens have instead channeled funds into the yen and euro."More people were talking in a lot more optimistic terms about the dollar," said Steve Barrow, chief currency strategist for Bear Stearns in London. That "was based largely on the perception that the U.S. has a lot of bad news priced in. The euro zone has stuff to come."

    <TEXT>Bhiwandi, India -- AS INDIA FACES criticism for luring white-collar jobs away from the U.S., what is sometimes lost is the larger challenge for India: Generating enough work for its own citizens.The workers at the center of the outsourcing uproar -- software engineers, customer-service agents, claims processors -- now number roughly one million, a small fraction of the country's work force of more than 400 million people. So while India's economy has shown impressive growth over the past year, beneath the numbers lies a paradox.For many Indians, the economy's resurgence isn't translating into the one thing they want most -- a steady paycheck. In fact, India has seen a marked decline in the number of jobs at companies with more than 10 employees in recent years.Sarwan Kumar is typical. He is one of the hundreds of millions who work in the so-called unorganized sector, which accounts for 92% of India's jobs. They are farmers, street vendors, truck drivers, traders or, like Mr. Kumar, migrant laborers. All have little or no job security.Mr. Kumar, now in his 20s, left his home in North India to become a loom worker in Bhiwandi, a dusty industrial town outside Bombay. When the local candidate for India's ruling party came looking for votes here in the national election now under way, he didn't find many takers. For these migrant workers, little has changed during the present government's tenure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Short-selling, among the riskiest of all stock market strategies, is starting to win converts among the most conservative of all investors -- pension funds.Unlike ordinary investors, short-sellers make money when a stock goes down, not up. They do this by borrowing shares from a broker and selling them -- betting that the stock will fall in value and that they can replace the borrowed shares later at a lower price.Because short-sellers thrive on corporate disasters and financial foul-ups, they are often reviled by companies whose shares they short and are accused of spreading lies to send stocks plunging. "There's this feeling that it's un-American, and that you shouldn't be dumping on other people," says short-seller Russ Faucett of Los Angeles-based Barrington Partners.Some pension funds and other institutional investors have expanded their use of sophisticated short-sale techniques to hedge against price drops hurting their stock holdings. But most funds have shunned short-selling as a money-making strategy in its own right.Now that's changing. "We're seeing more institutional money on the short side of the market, and much more is interested in pursuing" the strategy, says Michael Minikes, managing director of Bear, Stearns & Co., which lends stock to short-sellers and handles many short-sale trades. Institutional short-selling activity is tiny so far, but this "is just the beginning," he says.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone who listens to economists knows the U.S. economy has been doing pretty well, with productivity booming, capital spending on a tear, and cost pressures modest. This is the payback for laying off all those workers. The poor souls may be out of jobs, but look how lean and mean everyone else is.Except that now the Commerce Department has changed its mind. It has cooked up -- just what you were waiting for -- a new way of calculating the gross domestic product.Breathless as you may be for the math, it's the result that matters. The government (assuming it ever reopens) is about to air-brush its old GDP numbers, and in the process reverse much of the evidence for formerly well-accepted economic trends.Growth will suddenly shrink by a half percentage point a year or more. In a $7 trillion economy, that's a lot of shrinkage. What's more, the "productivity revolution" will vanish into some storage cellar of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or wherever they wind up stashing the old numbers.Productivity -- output per worker -- was rising in the '90s at 2.2% a year, more than double the rate of the '70s and '80s. Under Commerce's new math, the figure for the '90s will be only 1.4% -- now nearly identical to prior eras.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Inventing economic theories in an ivory tower is no substitute for living with the harsh reality of unemployment. Your Dec. 26 page-one article "Jobless Puzzle" described a trendy theory among academicians that the roots of unemployment lie in the "efficiency-wage" problem: unemployment persists because employers are paying artificially high wages in order to motivate workers to greater productivity. This prevents workers who are willing to work at a lower wage from finding jobs.My experience indicates otherwise. I lived in a low-income ghetto and there had a string of housemates who were unemployed when they moved in, yet healthy, young and clearly in possession of employable skills. Without exception, these men failed to follow up on job leads I gave them, they walked past help-wanted signs every day, they even refused my offer to pay them generously for household chores. They chose instead to borrow from friends during the times that their government checks for unemployment and disability (it was a fraud) fell short of their needs.This experience was a limited one yet I believe representative of a far broader problem. The men I lived with chose unemployment because it presented them with an economically desirable alternative to a life of work. Theirs was a low standard of living yet one they had grown accustomed to and complacent with. The professors studying unemployment would be wise to temper their fancy equations with some real-world experiences like these.J. TURNER JOHNSONMenlo Park, Calif.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK -- Interest rates are likely to move lower in coming months despite the woes of the U.S. dollar in the foreign exchange markets, according to many bankers and economists.Although the dollar's recent weakness caught forecasters off guard, these analysts say the currency turmoil only will delay the move toward lower interest rates. They predict business activity will slow sharply this quarter, leaving the Federal Reserve System with little choice but to ease credit conditions further.The Fed will reduce its discount rate to 5% by late March, many analysts contend. The discount rate, now 5 1/2%, is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions."I still think we'll see a further decline in short-term interest rates, although not as immediately as I would have expected" just a few weeks ago, said Kathleen Cooper, senior vice president and chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. The economy is "far from robust," she said, adding that a discount rate cut is likely late this quarter or early in the second quarter.The Commerce Department is scheduled to release Thursday its preliminary estimate of the economy's growth in last year's fourth quarter. Analysts generally estimate that the report will show the gross national product expanded at an annual rate of between 2.5% and 3%, after adjusting for inflation. That would be little changed from the third quarter's 2.8% pace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hong Kong -- AMERICAN COMPANIES operating in China enjoyed another year of strong profits in 2005, possibly even setting a record. But you would hardly guess it from company statements or the negative vibes on trade with China coming out of Congress these days.Corporate America often seems to go out of its way to hide its successes in China. That may not be the smartest strategy as U.S. politicians girding for a possible trade war highlight the corporate losers of trade with China, while ignoring the many winners.According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S.-affiliated companies in China -- companies in which U.S. firms have at least a 10% stake -- earned $3 billion in 2004. That's up from zero in 1990. Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist for Bank of America, says that figure is a good reflection of how U.S. companies are making out in the world's fourth-largest economy. He estimates earnings reached a record $3.2 billion in 2005.True, corporate profits from China accounted for just a sliver of the $209 billion earned by U.S. affiliates world-wide in 2004. Japan yielded $11.3 billion; Mexico, $7.6 billion. But China is becoming an increasingly attractive market for U.S. companies, even in some of the most competitive industries.Take the auto sector. As its losses piled up in the U.S., General Motors Corp. reported income from China of $218 million for the first nine months of 2005.

    <TEXT>Trip Hawkins, the charismatic chairman of 3DO Co., may be forced to dig deep into his own pockets to help keep his video-game player afloat for the next year, as a key partner and several game suppliers appear to be backing away.3DO is trying to break into the major leagues as the video-game industry, ruled by Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Nintendo Co., shifts to a more powerful breed of game machines. Some big names are backing 3DO's ambition, including Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Time Warner Inc. and AT&T Corp. The company says it has recruited 550 outside game developers and pressed over one million copies of 50 titles on compact disks that hold computer data. It also asserts it got off to a "strong start" in Japan, selling 80,000 machines in the first two months.But despite a blizzard of publicity generated in part by Mr. Hawkins's marketing skills, the company has been hampered by surprisingly slow initial sales in the U.S. where demanding kid consumers say the games don't offer enough pizazz for the $500 price. Only 40,000 units of its game player, sold under Matsushita's Panasonic label, have been sold since October despite a price cut from an original $700. "Everyone has been shocked at the lower sales," says a person close to the company. Now, after posting a $51.4 million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 3DO has about two quarters of cash left amid mounting expenses, such as a national advertising campaign and a shift to in-house game development.Mr. Hawkins, who is also chairman of video-game publisher Electronic Arts Inc., has sold nearly $15 million in Electronic Arts stock since November. A person familiar with his plans says he intends to put $10 million into 3DO and raise $10 million from GoldStar Co., a Korean conglomerate, and an additional $10 million from current partners in a private placement of stock by the end of June. The company had attempted to raise money through a secondary offering last December, but its sagging stock price thwarted the plan. Having peaked at $47 in October, the stock closed unchanged at $15.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday."I enjoy putting my money where my mouth is," Mr. Hawkins says, but declines to discuss specific plans for his money or identify any next-round investors. As for 3DO's cash squeeze, he says, "It's a moot point . . . There is plenty of money that wants to be invested in the company."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The U.S. dollar slipped against major foreign currencies yesterday in response to easing U.S. interest rates and strong demand for West German marks.Gold rose $3.10 an ounce as a result of the weaker dollar, which makes dollar-denominated investments look less attractive.Also adding to the pressure on the dollar yesterday was trader expectation of a sizable U.S. merchandise trade deficit report for February, to be announced today. The latest market expectation is that the deficit will amount to $7.9 billion and, says Daniel Holland, a vice president of Foreign Currency Management Inc., New York, "that took a little steam out of the dollar."Mr. Holland said "the only thing that could boost the dollar this week would be a trade deficit that isn't as sizable as expected."The dollar's decline began almost as soon as New York trading began, and it accelerated when the dollar broke through 2.5850 marks; in late New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 2.5713 marks.</TEXT>
