    <TEXT>This little question is the third rail of technology journalism. No other aspect of personal computing attracts so much emotion, or lands so much hate-mail in journalists' in boxes accusing them of bias. To make my own background clear: I've got a Mac on my desk at home and a PC on my desk at work. I swear at both. If it means anything, I've gotten a little more hate-mail from Apple advocates than PC partisans.But apart from those true believers, there are people who would just like to know which platform will be a better fit for their own purposes. There's no right answer, but here are a few things to ponder:Cost: At the entry level, there's no longer a big difference between the prices of Macs and PCs. The cheapest PC-and-monitor combo with 64 megabytes of memory (a realistic minimum) at Best Buy's site costs $580 after a rebate. The cheapest iMac system available costs $800. That $220 isn't pocket change, but it's not a huge gap, either.Apple stays roughly competitive with its rivals throughout the iMac line. But between $1,500 and $2,000, Apple has nothing to compete with Windows machines. If you're looking for a computer with some open expansion slots and a 17-inch monitor, a desktop PC will be awfully cheap compared to a Power Mac G4.Reliability: Both operating systems crash. A lot. Yes, it's possible to fine-tune either system to a remarkable degree of stability, but most users have neither the time nor the aptitude for that kind of tweaking. (I'm not addressing Microsoft's more reliable, more expensive and more resource-intensive Windows 2000, which is designed for business use.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In a grim assessment of the global economic outlook, the World Bank yesterday said that some of the world's least developed countries already have suffered a slump worse than the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s.Although U.S. government officials have shown optimism about the short-term global economic outlook, the present pattern of slow growth among developed nations and in developing countries raises concerns about the longer-term future, said the bank's annual World Development Report.The report by the bank's staff was sharply critical of Reagan administration policies, which it said contributed to the "economic turbulence and uncertainty" that have produced high interest rates, declining investment, rising protectionism and high unemployment in Europe.Stanley Fisher, chief economist for the bank, acknowledged that "the world economy appears to be in better shape" than when the report was completed a few months ago.Fisher acknowledged that the Reagan administration's strategy for dealing with the massive debts of many Third World nations, which avoids debt relief except for impoverished African countries, has left major Latin American debtors in no better shape than they were three years ago.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>or which rights. What baffles these senators is Bork۪s recognition of the problem that a judge has to choose among rights and his effort to find some principled basis for the choice. In all of their sentimental demagoguery about rights his opponents have never explained whose rights they want to subordinate. I have heard nothing from Bork to deny that the definition and allocation of rights properly change over time, by legislative action or judicial decisions, in response to changing conditions, including community values. But what I do hear from him is a reluctance to make a leap in the dark, declaring rights in particular cases without weighing the indirect and future consequences of such declarations.This brings up the question of precedents. There has been much discussion of whether Judge Bork properly respects the precedents created by previous court decisions. No attention has been paid to the question of a justice۪s respect for his successors, who may be bound by the precedents he sets. What I understand Bork to say is that a justice should not set precedents for his successors without carefully considering the full range of their implications.The Gnsuxdd case, in which we have all had' an education in the last two weeks, is an example. Here was a stupid Connecticut law banning the use of contraceptives. The question is whether the best way to get rid of that stupid class. His iconodasm, while stimulating in a professor, can be disastrous in a judge. What is important is not how nimble his argument will be, but how his' decisions will affect millions of Americans who will have to live by them.So ultimately what we۪re asking is not only what۪s in Judge Bork۪s mind but also what۪s in his heart Is he sensitive to human and racial problems?I can hear his supporters saying that here comes the irrational argument. But it is prudence, not irrationality, to give as much emphasis to citizen Bork۪s past views as to nominee Bork۪s new views. His supporters say, "Can۪t one change his views?۝ Yes, certainly. Otherwise, how could we, in the last 32 years, have1 moved from a time when the air was heavy with racism to one in which the union of religious faith and civic action has begun to create a new American reality. So, yes, people can change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK, Nov. 12Presi-de'nt Bush, on the political defensive as! he begins his reelection drive, today put the blame for the recession on Senate Democrats and offered a stew of remedies that mixed everything from tort reform to a plia to credit card firms to drop thtir interest rates.fn the third of a series of Bush-Qqayle fund-raising events. Bush portrayed himself as having a full program to deal with the nation's ills anti said the Democrats have resisted that program at every turn.In a broadside at Congress, Bush said the American people "have seen Congress up close and they۪ve seen their inability to move when Americans demand action.۝ he accused Congress of an endless appetite for sideshows that have really kind of embarrassed our country" and of overindulgence in pehts and privileges.۝ Pounding the leijtem, he insisted, I۪m not going to; be the javelin-catcher for the liberals in Congress anymore.۝On the economy, Bush said what the nation needs is "confidence" and he offered one suggestion that was new for him. I would like to see those credit card rates go down," he said, adding he had discussed the idea with business executives. He called again for his capital gains tax cut and blamed Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Maine) for stopping it and thus causing the recession.Noting there were enough votes to pass it in 1989, Bush said, "It took a last-minute political maneuver by Senator Mitchell to block the package.۝ Mitchell, he said, "got that political victory and eight months later our economy slipped into a recession."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wholesale prices declined for the second consecutive month in July, the first back-to-back decreases in two years.Yesterday's Commerce Department report drove interest rates on long-term bonds - a benchmark for mortgage interest rates - to record lows after analysts and the financial markets interpreted the news as calming persistent fears of inflation.At the same time, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales showed meager improvement, held back by a decline in car sales.Taken together, the two reports portray an economy that is growing slowly, neither encouraging consumers to spend more nor triggering rapid price increases, analysts said."We're still getting a modest recovery," said Stephen Roach, co- director of global economic analysis at Morgan Stanley & Co. in New York.</TEXT>
