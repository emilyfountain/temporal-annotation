    <TEXT>Gov. L. Douglas Wilder told legislative leaders today that Virginia is coming out of the recession slower than the rest of the nation, and as evidence said that tax collections for the current budget year are projected to be $151 million less than expected just six months ago.The governor said one member of his Advisory Council on Revenue Estimates called it a "stealth recovery - so slow it would be difficult to see."Because of a previous agreement with the legislature, Wilder told the legislature's three money committees that he would use most of his $200 million rainy-day fund to make up for the shortfall, rather than further cutting programs and jobs.The one bit of good news that Wilder offered today was that he would support an additional $15 million for local school aid.Wilder said his economic advisers predict that the state "will continue to under-perform the national economy in housing construction, consumer spending and employment growth" during the next 11 months. The state has lost about 49,000 jobs in the last year, more than half in Northern Virginia, Wilder said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D) said he believes business leaders who supported his efforts to raise taxes and balance the state's budget will also support John F. Kerry for president because they are concerned about the economy and the size of the federal budget deficit.In a conference call with reporters in southern states, Warner said the historical pattern of business leaders backing Republican candidates will be broken this year, nationally and in Virginia."You've got more business support this year for the Kerry ticket than even [Bill] Clinton did in 1992," he said. "There's a real unease among many of the business leaders in the state."On Monday, the Kerry campaign released a list of 200 business executives nationwide who have signaled their support for the Democratic nominee. The list contained three names from Virginia: Vinton G. Cerf, senior vice president of technology strategy for MCI; Roger W. Sant, co-founder and chairman emeritus of AES Corp.; and Warren M. Thompson, chairman and president of Thompson Hospitality in Herndon.The Democratic National Committee has begun airing a television ad in Virginia called "Strength" that uses clips from Kerry's acceptance speech at the party's nominating convention last week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NORFOLKCargo volume on the piers of Hampton Roads has fallen so drastically over the past three years that port employers are no longer able to fund an unemployment program for longshoremen.Guaranteed Annual Income, the only unemployment program available to more than 950 Hampton Roads longshoremen, is broke, according to a suit filed in U.S. District Court.The International Longshoremen۪s Association has asked the court to grant it a judgment of $8.5 million against Hampton Roads Shipping Association, an organization of port employers.The lLA contend^ the shippers are con-, tracturally obligated to fund the program and that the judgment would allow unemployment compensation to be paid through the end of September 1983.There are a lot of longshoremen out there who are getting hungry,۝ said an official of the GAI fund who asked not to be identified. He said that since Oct 1 an estimated 250 to 300 longshoremen have been out of work and without the GAI, which in the past assured them a paycheck during slack periods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NEW YORK, May 14 (AP)The latest stock market rally petered out early today after two solid days of advance. Prices ended mixed.Du Pont, however, made another big gain, rising 6% to 261. This was enough o overcome losses in some competent stocks and push the closely-watched Dow-Jones industrial average to another historic high of 939.62 with a gain of .75.Du Pont made a high for the year and its advance was on top of a rise of 5% in the previous session. The stock was in renewed demand because directors meet on Monday and there is hope, once again, that they wil propose a stock split. Du Pont has also been spurred by reports of its big growth since it disposed of its General Motors holdings.The rise in the Dow industrials was not an accurate reflection of the market, however. Of 1378 issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange, 572 declined and 543 advanced. New highs for the year totaled 106 and new lows 22.The list moved a little higher in early trading, then faltered. Analysts called it pre-weekend profit taking based on the current high level of the list.</TEXT>
